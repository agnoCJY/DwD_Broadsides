CHELMSFORD, Oct. 4th, 1821.' It was published by William Carse of Glasgow, and probably sold for one penny.
William Carse was one of a number of prominent publishers working out of the Saltmarket area of Glasgow in the early nineteenth century. Along with his two main competitors, John Muir and Thomas Duncan, Carse vied to be the first to issue circuit court lists, last speeches and lamentations. Competition was extremely fierce and, in order to survive, broadside producers had to work fast.

A stone has been inserted over the main door, bearing the following inscription: MARTYRS' CHURCH, Erected in 1835, by the Friends of the Church of Scotland.' Printed by Caldwell and Son, and taken from the 'Liberator', this account tells of James Algie and John Park, 'who suffered at the cross of Paisley, on the 3rd of February, 1685'.
This broadside uses stirring rhetoric to recount an incident that occurred around 150 years prior to its publication. Its newsworthiness lies in the renaming of the Broomlands church to the 'Martyrs' Church', and this has been combined with the intriguing and sensationalised story of the two 'noble martyrs', Algie and Park. Whilst the renaming of the church was topical and of interest to some in the 1830s, the printer was guaranteed to sell more copies by including the shocking details of the 'Martyrdom'. The martyrs referred to were Covenanters -  Presyterians who were persecuted during the reign of King Charles II.

This sheet discusses how citizens should dress on the day that royalty visits. White trousers and waistcoat and a blue jacket are suggested as is a St Andrews emblem worn on the side of the hat. From the context of the piece it seems to refer to George IV's visit to Edinburgh in 1822 - the first royal visit for over 150 years. The tour was stage-managed by Sir Walter Scott, who created a kind of false, romantic Scotland, in the vein of his writing style. It is curious to note that these clothing suggestions are only for men and that the presence of women is not even hinted at.

The author of the ballad is named on the sheet as George Billinge. The broadside was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow. It is not dated, but was probably published either between 1852 and 1859, or between 1891 and 1894, when Lindsay is known to have had premises at 9 King Street
'The Sebastopol Fashions' is a song mocking Russian lifestyle. It was probably written as anti-Russian propaganda during the Crimean War (1854-56). France and Britain, declared war in an attempt to prevent Russian expansion, as Russia was seeking to control the Dardanelles and Britain's Mediterranean sea routes. Sebastopol, the Russian-held principal city in the area, was besieged and finally fell to the French and British on 11 September 1855. The intentional irony of 'Sebastopol Fashions' is that as a city under siege, Sebastopol would have experienced terrible hardships and shortages, and life there would have been quite unlike the luxurious picture painted by the song.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

Mr Fashioner replies that he can scarce 'shite them out', meaning he can hardly make enough of them. The first line of the poem underneath runs, 'All the inventions that ever was known'. Above the poem is a woodcut print representing the devil producing hooped petticoats.
Hooped petticoats, or farthingles, became popular in the early eighteenth century. The author of this satire takes a very dim view of them, basically calling them the devil's work. Another broadside, entitled 'The Lady's Answer, to the Sev'ral Little Satyres on the Hoop'd Petticoats' explains why the ladies like their farthingles so much, they'd 'rather chuse these huge unwieldy Tails, / Than the too near Incroachments of the Males'!

14942,clothing,L.C.Fol.70(31a),"This ballad begins: 'There's puir wee Johnny Clark, / That Sells the News and Star, / He whistles and he sings, / And he paddles through the glaur'. 'Glaur' is a Scots word used to describe muddy, slippery, and especially icy conditions. The song was published by the Poet's Box of Dundee.
Johnny Clark is a well-liked paperboy, but his appearance is dreadful. He needs a coat, so his mother makes him a jacket out of his father's old one. Unfortunately, it seems Johnny is scruffy by nature, because the thing he is most excited about is the fact that the pockets can hold a pound of potatoes!
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

Her brother though 5 years older was but an apprentice tailor, and his scanty wages went but a short way in supporting them'.
'Human interest' stories, sometimes touching or heroic, sometimes farcical or bizarre, were less popular than crime reports but were still carried regularly on broadsides. The example shown here is one of the more bizarre stories. It recounts how Margaret McDonald, an orphan, supported herself by assuming the identity of a boy and going into service with a well-off Edinburgh family. Her true gender was uncovered accidentally at her wedding to another woman, a revelation which, according to the author, afforded 'great mirth' to all the wedding guests, if not to the bride.

This poem, due to its lack of contextual information, is a little difficult to understand. The only real record of Lucky Gibson left for posterity seems to be this broadside. From some of the scenarios and language used here, it would appear that Lucky kept a 'house of ill-repute'. It is implied that now this service had been withdrawn from the community there would be a vacuum in the leisure market. Surprisingly for broadside literature it is not judgmental in tone.

'Morbus' is Latin for 'sickness' or 'disease'. No publication details have been included on this sheet, and, unfortunately, the top left-hand corner is missing.
Although the morbus in this instance appears to be an outbreak of cholera, there are also deep political undertones throughout these verses. Unfortunately, with no date attached to this sheet, it is difficult to determine when it was published. There were several outbreaks of cholera in Glasgow in the nineteenth century, the first of which, in 1832, killed around 3,000 people. As conditions in Glasgow, and the other major towns and cities, were overcrowded and unhygenic, with virtually no sanitation, infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid had the potential to spread like wildfire.

The date stated on the sheet is the 27th of December, and a hand-written entry inserted after the printed text identifies the year as 1830. The sheet was published by John Campbell of Edinburgh.
This broadside news account tells of a tragedy involving an explosion at an army camp in the British colony of Gibraltar, which killed 11 soldiers. Most of the story comes from a letter of explanation written by a corporal of the 42nd regiment (known as the Royal Highland Regiment or the Black Watch) to James Bryce in Lanark, father of William, who was one of the deceased soldiers. The corporal's letter is extremely graphic in its description of this dreadful accident, which occurred during gunnery practice.

It is not clear why we are told that the author was in a fire in Edinburgh's Canongate. Neither is it clear why the verse is dedicated to 'Lord Balmerino'.

The text preceding it reads: 'TO THE / Praise of the Weavers / GIVING AN / Account of their behaviour at a Wedding in Elgin of Murray. / to its own proper Tune.'
The names Gordon and Murray are mentioned in this rather violent but hilariously recounted wedding day. Perhaps there is the suggestion of continued family rivalry which was prevalent among the close-knit but extended families of Northern Scotland. Weavers were also notorious for their aggressive bad behaviour. They were well-paid for craftsmen but they had to defend their livelihood against foreign imports. This often led to public clashes with the authorities.

The ballad was to be sung 'To its own proper new Tune'.
Weavers were a hugely important part of the industrial growth of Scotland, particularly in the eighteenth century when new technology improved the quantity and quality of yarn that could be produced quickly. The textile industry was the hub of the first phase of industrial revolution, swelling Scotland's cities and the town of Paisley in particular. The invention of the power loom reduced the demand for handloom weavers in the nineteenth century, but they remained a politically powerful group of craftsmen.

Despite the alternative spelling of Burk in the headline, this sensational broadside purports to be a chilling list detailing the list of victims of the notorious murderers William Burke and William Hare. In 1827, these two underworld characters started murdering people for profit. Although the dates and names of the victims are genuine enough, there is no way of knowing if these 'Curious Papers' did in fact belong to Burke, or whether it was just a case of a market-aware printer looking for a subject that would sell numerous broadsides.

This verse appears to recount a resurrectionist's encounter with the devil, during which the devil states 'I came just to tell ye, the doctors are writing, / And thinking to ruin both us and our cause'. Whilst the resurrectionist appears horrified by the spectre in front of him, the devil considers them 'True brothers'. Resurrectionists, also known as body-snatchers, were particularly feared and reviled by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century society. Their crime involved removing bodies from fresh graves and selling them for dissection. The resurrectionist in this verse is obviously plagued by a guilty conscience, which manifests itself in his dreams.

This broadside purports to report on a chilling murder of two fish-women from Leith, whose bodies were apparently found in a barrel. It could well be, however, that this is just a fictional story that fed on the fears that existed in Edinburgh after the notorious actions of Burke and Hare. Certainly, there are no definite details to prove the truth of the story, with the writer frequently employing doubtful phrases such as 'if true', 'it appears' and 'it is rumoured'. The word 'burking' entered the lexicon around the time that Burke and Hare committed their awful deeds, but, thankfully, has since become a dormant word.

It was published by J. Seller of Edinburgh, in 1825.
This broadside reflects the level of concern that existed in 1820s Edinburgh over the practice of resurrectionism, or body-snatching. Some anatomy lecturers, frustrated by laws that allowed only the bodies of certain executed criminals to be donated to medical science, were willing to pay well for corpses that could be used for experiment and demonstration. The practice thus gained popularity among the criminal fraternity. Resurrectionism held a particular horror for many devoutly presbyterian Scots, who believed that to gain salvation their bodies must be buried on hallowed ground.
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers. Crimes could generate sequences of sheets covering descriptive accounts, court proceedings, last words, lamentations and executions as they occurred.

The broadside tells of the riot that took place in Edinburgh on 12 February 1829, when a mob marched to the house of Dr. Robert Knox and demanded justice. Although Dr. Knox was the eminent anatomist who bought corpses at £10 a time from the infamous body-snatchers, Burke and Hare, he was never prosecuted. His career, however, was effectively destroyed. It appears from this riot that the public considered him to be an accomplice - hence the stones thrown at his house. This broadside contains a darkly humorous sting in the tale, as it concludes with a funny story concerning how a local anatomist was persuaded to buy a dead sow to help advance his studies.

The riot described in this report apparently came about when the trial of two resurrectionists, or body-snatchers, was halted pro loco et tempore. In Scots Law this phrase refers to a case where the trial is stopped but the prosecution retains the right to bring a fresh indictment against the accused. The 1820s saw mounting concern in Scotland over the theft and sale of newly-buried bodies for anatomical research. The outrage reached its peak in 1828 when William Burke and William Hare were founded to have committed multiple murders in Edinburgh to find fresh subjects for the anatomists.

This is one article of many held in the National Library of Scotland's collection which detail the case of the bodysnatchers and murderers William Burke and William Hare. As a result it is also an article which added its opinion to the already huge nineteenth century debate on human dissection. Copying the article from a newspaper was not at all unusual, as newspaper reporters travelled further afield, but the broadside production made the story much more accessible. There were also much more ambiguous copyright laws at this time.
Burke and Hare were Irish bodysnatchers and murderers, who worked around Edinburgh's Canongate area - eventually becoming local legends. They hit upon the idea of murdering vulnerable or solitary people (in an attempt not to get caught) so that they could sell the bodies for dissection. Hare turned King's Evidence and so was acquitted, but this secured the conviction of Burke, who was hanged on the 28th January 1829.",Broadside entitled 'Riot at Dumfries! Hares Arrival',1829

Although no date of publication is included, the subject matter suggests it was probabably printed in the 1830s. The sheet was published by John Campbell of Edinburgh.
Most likely written around the time when Burke and Hare terrorised Edinburgh (c. 1829-30), this broadside report would have scared the public with its dark tales of the 'Resurrectionists' (i.e. grave robbers). The writer sensationally describes an incident whereby a carriage was seized by a suspicious Edinburgh mob near the anatomy theatre, and the body of a 50-year-old woman discovered inside the coach. In this atmosphere of mass hysteria, the word 'burke' gatecrashed its way into the lexicon - and appears in the sub-title at the foot of this broadside.

Although Burke was hanged in Edinburgh before a crowd of around 40,000, Hare was freed after turning King's evidence.

Here, feeling bored by inaction, they decided to deliver their 'dead' friend to a doctor for the price of three pound. When the doctor re-entered his cellar the 'dead body' miraculously awoke and ran away - with the money of course!
Burke and Hare were Irish bodysnatchers and murderers, who worked around Edinburgh's Canongate area - eventually becoming local legends. They hit upon the idea of murdering vulnerable or solitary people (in an attempt not to get caught) so that they could sell the bodies for dissection. Hare turned King's Evidence and so was acquitted, but this secured the conviction of Burke, who was hanged on the 28th January 1829.",Broadside entitled 'A New Way of Raising the Wind!',1829

This poem was published on 3rd July 1869 by the Poet's Box in Glasgow, priced one penny. At the foot of the sheet it is noted 'The POET is universally admitted to be the cheapest LETTERPRESS PRINTER in the city'. The 'POET' is not named.
This ballad was written in 1796 by the poet Robert Southey (1774-1843). It tells a haunting tale that is more unusual and complex than many featured in broadside ballads. Beginning with an image of Mary as a 'poor maniac', the story then moves back in time to when Mary was a carefree young girl. To settle a wager, she agrees to visit an old abbey on a stormy night, and in so doing discovers that her fiancé Richard is a body-snatcher. Richard is hanged, and Mary's life is ruined.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson. 
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing.

Jamie is a soldier in the 'Forty-and-Two', which is the 42nd Highland Regiment, more commonly known today as the Black Watch. The mention that Jamie has been posted to the (West) Indies, in the final verse, makes it likely that the song was composed in the late eighteenth century. The 42nd went on expedition there in 1793, for over three years. They captured the islands of St Lucia and St Vincent.

This broadside was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow.
The River Slaney, which divides County Wexford in Ireland diagonally in two, is steeped in mythology and historical significance. Its name is derived from a mythic chieftain named Slainghe, and its waters have been navigated by Christian missionaries, Norse invaders and Normans in turn. Perhaps because of the area's rich heritage, the author of this ballad has cast his lovers in mythological terms. Like the 'noble heroes' in many myths, the narrator of the ballad is caught in an apparently endless quest to win the hand of his love.

And yet it is easy, at least for us. First know whom you are going to kiss.' Although no publication date is included, a note at the foot of the sheet states that it was published, or supplied, by 'L. Macartney, The Poet's Box, 184 Overgate, Dundee'.
This whimsical and light-hearted ballad considers the often fraught subject of how to kiss properly. It appeared in the diary of one Joseph J. Corneille, from Louisiana in 1868. He seems to have been something of an expert in this field. Corneille starts off by describing the mechanics of the action, before concluding with the heavenly bliss that a properly performed - and aimed - kiss can bring forth. Although written to amuse its audience, the writer also offers some useful tips into how the individual might improve his or her kissing performance. While modern-day readers might find this broadside rather quaint, it should be remembered that the content is not that different from the features that regularly appear in today's magazines for young teenagers.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.

The sheet carries no publication details.
'Sally Munro' is narrated by a Scotsman whose bride dies when the ship taking them to Canada sinks. The National Library of Scotland holds several broadside ballads on the same theme, reflecting the sad fact that this was not an uncommon event. Emigration from the Scottish Highlands and Ireland to North America ran at a high level in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly at times of crop failure and poverty. Frequently the ships crossing the Atlantic were overcrowded and in bad repair, and this inevitably led to ships sinking and many lives being lost.

The broadside carries no publication details.
The National Library holds more than one broadside featuring 'Sally Munro', which suggests that it was quite a popular song. This is unsurprising, as it contains some of the more common themes in broadside ballads. The story is of a Scotsman who is separated from the Irish girl he loves, but is finally reunited with her and marries her, only to lose her again when the ship they are emigrating on sinks, and Sally is drowned. Love songs were always popular with broadside audiences, and the themes of separation and tragedy often accompanied them, as in this case. In addition, the Irish aspect of the song probably made 'Sally Munro' more popular, as Lowland Scotland had a high Irish immigrant population.

An epitaph has also been included at the bottom of this sheet.
It is believed this elegy was written by the Scottish-born poet and song collector Allan Ramsay (1685-1758). The subject of the elegy, Lucky Wood, is thought to have been the landlady of an alehouse in Edinburgh's Canongate. Although many of the elegies published as broadsides remembered prominent figures such as King William III and Robert Walpole, a large number also mourned the passing of local characters such as Lucky, a brothel-keeper.

This elegy lingers on the deep friendship that obviously existed between James Fleming Cannon and the author, Kelso Kelly. Whilst mourning the death of his friend, Kelly is reassured by his memories and the belief that 'Thy gracious presence, too, shall stay with me ; / The good dies not ; the face, the form may pass, / But ever ever clear as in a glass / The mind can mirror what sight cannot see.' To warrant this elegy and its publication, James Fleming Cannon must have been a well-known figure. Although he has since disappeared into obscurity, this tribute has succeeded in keeping his memory alive.

After this note, there is a Latin quotation from one of Horace's works.
Employing a famous character from the classical myths, this erudite ballad contains a series of dialogues between the beautiful - but doomed - Adonis and an obscure nymph called Melindor. The alternating verses between these two characters contain many references to other characters from classical mythology, as they discuss the state of the world and nature. The ballad is dedicated to the memory of William Nisbet (or Nesbit), who belonged to the famous legal family who lived in the village of Dirleton, just outside Edinburgh.

This ballad should be sung to the air, 'The Miner's Dream of Home'. It was published by the 'Poet's Box' of 181 Overgate, Dundee. It would have cost a penny to buy or a penny-and-half by post.
The steam-ship the 'Berlin' was built in 1894 by the Earles Shipping and Engineering Company of Hull. It was commissioned and operated by the Great Eastern Railway Company who sailed it between Harwich and the Hook of Holland. This poem refers to its tragic sinking on the 21st February 1907, with a loss of over a hundred lives. Captain Sperling was on duty that night and although a mixture of passengers and crew were lost, most of the crew hailed from the Harwich area.

This sheet was printed by James Docherty of Edinburgh.'
Priced at one penny, this broadside tells of the tragic fate that befell the White family, who all died in a snowstorm while travelling to Penicuik, near Edinburgh. It seems that John White was a handloom weaver by trade. Following the invention and mass manufacture of weaving machinery, handloom weavers were forced to become itinerant workers, and they suffered terrible hardships as they searched for work.
In addition to including a prose account of the tragedy, this broadsheet also contains an account of the story in verse. It is interesting to consider why the story was repeated in different formats. It could be that an individual would read out the broadside to listeners, and that the verses helped to make the story more dramatic.

This broadside tells the tragic story of the terrible fate that befell passengers on an overloaded boat, during a journey on the River Tweed between Muiross (Melrose) and Gallowshiels (Galashiels). It seems that a lethal combination of an overloaded boat and adverse weather conditions led to the boat's capsizing, and the consequent loss of 40 lives. The writer blames the boatman's covetousness for causing this tragedy, and comments that the boatman should not have taken on so many passengers. Its seems that the passengers were on their way to Muiross to enjoy the visiting Fair. A strong religious tone runs through this report, revealing much about the nature of Scottish society at this time.

McInnes and McBride were accused of culpable homicide after their steamboat collided with another vessel on its journey from Inverness to Glasgow. Over sixty people appear to have died as a result of the accident. After the evidence was heard at their trial, the jury found McInnes guilty and McBride not guilty. At a time when people were being executed for petty crimes, such as housebreaking and theft, it is surprising that McInnes, after being found guilty, was only sentenced to three months' imprisonment.

The 'Rockites' was a name given to those involved in the 'Whiteboy movement' in Cork during the 1820s. The 'Whiteboys' were a secret society which originated in Limerick in the 1760s. They were strongly opposed to changes that were taking place in Irish agriculture at this time. They were renowned for their direct action, which often included targeting those in authority and sabotaging farmland.

Probably more from entrepreneurial than public-spirited motives, Frederick Morris proposes a system of using carbonic acid gas, more commonly referred to today as carbon dioxide, to extinguish fires. His idea of installing pipes into buildings, and controlling the release of the gas using a stopcock was never taken up, presumably for logistical as well as safety reasons (the gas is highly toxic if inhaled). However, many fire extinguishers today contain carbon dioxide.

The crimes of Burke and Hare inspired a great number of broadsides. As well as numerous accounts of Burke's trial, subsequent detailed confessions and execution, various ballads and poems were written about the case. In this poem, the author describes the crowd at Burke's execution shouting 'Burk him, Burk him.' The crowd were probably suggesting that Burke should have done to him what he did to others. This was almost certainly the first use of the verb 'to burk', meaning to murder or strangle, which subsequently became a quite common phrase.
Burke and Hare were Irish bodysnatchers and murderers, who worked around Edinburgh's Canongate area, eventually becoming local legends. They hit upon the idea of murdering solitary or vulnerable people (in an attempt not to get caught) so that they could sell the bodies for dissection.

There are many sheets held in the National Library of Scotland's collection which cover the murders and trials of the Williams Burke and Hare. Their content would suggest that there was great outrage and horror felt by the inhabitants of Edinburgh about the nature and details of these crimes. It is curious to note that although Hare confessed to his part in the crimes, he turned King's Witness and so was immune from prosecution. As a result, in the literature of the time, the murders are referred to as Burke's! There is also very little mention made of the surgeons who bought the bodies, despite the fact that they suffered attacks and abuse in Edinburgh at the time.

Illustrated with a woodcut of William Hare, the writer of this ballad spares no details in describing to his audience the terrible crimes perpetrated by William Burke and William Hare. Edinburgh experienced a brief reign of terror in 1829, when these two bodysnatchers decided that murdering people would help to increase the number of  payments they received from Dr Knox, of Edinburgh's Anatomy School. As highlighted in the small report underneath the ballad, the Edinburgh populace considered Dr Knox to be almost as guilty as Burke and Hare, and a mob stoned Dr Knox's house.

The sheet was published by Robert Forrest in June 1823 and cost a penny.
Stevenson had been previously convicted of violating graves, under the name of Hodge, and had been very badly treated by the people of Linlithgow afterward. It is interesting to note that the judge reprimands the people, saying it is not for them to take the law into their own hands. It is strange that the sheet does not mention what drove Stevenson to commit the crimes or who Janet Moir was. He was sentenced to seven years' transportation.
It is interesting to note that this incident took place a few years before the great body-snatchers, Burke and Hare, begun their spree in 1827 and 1828. After the great publicity involving their case, such acts became known as 'burking'.",Broadside entitled 'Violating Sepulchres',1823

Burke, together with his accomplice William Hare, has become a famous part of Edinburgh's gruesome past. They were murderers, who sold cadavers to the medical school. Burke was convicted of three murders, and was tried alongside his partner, Helen McDougall. McDougall, Hare and his wife, were not charged, although the National Library of Scotland holds some broadsides telling of the public's anger towards them as they tried to lead normal lives after the trial.

'1828' is handwritten on the sheet in two places.
Despite the jury's recommendation of mercy, Andrew Ewart was sentenced to be executed for the murder of his friend Henry Pennycook (or Pennycuick). This broadside covers the events which led up to Pennycook's death. After an evening in the watch-house of Liberton churchyard, and much talk of body-snatching, Ewart unwittingly mistook his friend for a graverobber and fired a fatal shot. On discovering he had fatally wounded his friend, Ewart was devastated. It is important to remember that the grisly act of body-snatching was a very real concern for people at this time.

William Burke and his partner Helen MacDougall, worked with two accomplices, William Hare and his wife, to lure people to their death. They then sold the body on to medical practitioners for dissection. They had committed sixteen murders when they were caught, mainly of vulnerable people. Burke was eventually convicted and ordered to hang, but only because his accomplice turned King's Evidence and therefore survived. The accusation against MacDougall was not proven.

The Editor talks about himself but does not give his names. There are also no publication details included.
This text is one of many which featured in the Victorian debate over human dissection in the name of medical advance. Although socially frowned upon, the medical establishment was desperate for bodies to work on so that biological processes to could be better understood. This resulted in the new crime of 'body snatching' where cadavers were dug out of fresh graves and sold illicitly to doctors. This eventually lead to the infamous case of Burke and Hare who began to murder people, to sell their bodies for profit.
Burke and Hare were Irish bodysnatchers and murderers, who worked around Edinburgh's Canongate area - eventually becoming local legends. They hit upon the idea of murdering vulnerable or solitary people (in an attempt not to get caught) so that they could sell the bodies for dissection.

The first ballad explores the timeless theme of a young man's imagination running away with itself, upon meeting his beloved walking along a street. Suddenly, the audience is magically transported into a peaceful dale inhabited by larks and nightingales, while the young lovers lock arms. The second ballad appears to be a eulogy dedicated to two young ladies who are graceful and beautiful.

Very little information is known about the lyrics to this ballad but there is a similar ballad dated c.1680 entitled 'The West-Country Damosels Complaint'. As with all narratives in the oral tradition there was scope for changing details to interest the audience.

'Ava' means 'at all' and 'loon' means 'man' or 'boy'.
This light-hearted ballad tells of the humorous episodes that a young man from the country (from Fintry in Stirlingshire) experiences upon moving to the big city of Glasgow. Most of these episodes centre on how city people, thinking Johnny Raw is wet behind the ears because he is from the country, try to take advantage of his innocence and honesty. However, Johnny is nobody's fool, and is quite capable of looking after himself.

The sheet was published by J. Bowie, printer, of 49 Causeyside, Paisley. A woodblock showing a sailing ship has been used twice to decorate the top of the page.
This famous ballad was written by Thomas Campbell (1777-1844), a poem who wrote 'Gertrude of Wyoming' and 'Theodoric'. The idea for this song seems to have been borrowed from an old song entitled, ?Ye Gentlemen of England,? written by Martyn Parker (d.1630).
It sings the praises of the English Navy which played a very important role in securing the whole of Great Britain's safety from invasion for a very long time. Great heroes such as Nelson (1758-1805) are praised. The song ends on a positive note, and looks to quieter times ahead, 'when the storm has ceased to blow'.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century.

These topics were important to Scottish society as a whole, and would have been instantly recognisable to most of the audience.

The Worshipful Company of Cordwainers was given its first Ordinance, thus making it official, in 1272. They chose St Crispin as their patron saint due to his involvement in and association with shoemaking. This poem refers to the Saint and his day, October 25th. On this day a traditional holiday was declared for shoemakers, on which a festival was held. The apprentices on this day had a reputation for creating mayhem and making a nuisance of themselves.

The 'Wonderful Grey Horse' described by this ballad, is a magical horse that has apparently been present at some of the greatest moments of history, from the fall of Adam in the Garden of Eden, to the Battle of Waterloo. His age and experiences have whitened his hair, which originally was bay, or chestnut-coloured. The final four verses of the ballad, which refer to the Irish nationalists Patrick Sarsfield (c.1650-93) and Daniel O' Connell (1775-1847) as heroes, reveal that it is being narrated by a supporter of the Irish Home Rule Movement, and was probably published in the mid-nineteenth century.

Although larger, more expensive newspapers co-existed alongside broadsides and even provided the sources for some broadside stories, broadsides are recognised as being the forerunners of modern tabloids. The similarity is most obvious in the tendency of both broadside and tabloids to sensationalise stories and concentrate on the more outrageous or extreme aspects of human behaviour. However, the broadside pictured here anticipates tabloid reporting in a slightly different way, by including three very brief human interest stories from around the country.

On the night of 28 December 1879, the Tay Railway Bridge collapsed in high winds while a train was crossing it . All seventy-five people on board the train were killed. As is often the case with human tragedies, the event compelled people to write poems and songs as memorials to the victims. There is more than one poem commemorating the disaster in the National Library of Scotland's collection of broadsides, and the Dundee poet William McGonagall also wrote some famous verses about it.

This ballad refers to the Tay Bridge disaster. The middle section of the Tay Railway Bridge collapsed in hurrcane-force winds on the night of 28 December 1879 while a train was crossing it. The seventy-five people on board the train were all killed. An enquiry found that the architect, Sir Thomas Bouch, had not taken the estuary winds into account in his original design.

This 'best Dog in the East Nook Coast' (East Fife) is to be hung. Though 'not too old', his usefulness is gone. Even today, many greyhounds are put down or abandoned for precisely this reason. The poem highlights the dog's good temperament and his devotion to his master, and seems to be saying it is wrong to terminate the its life.

This list of ships also gives details of the class of vessel, allowing historians to ascertain the type of trade that was occurring at the Broomielaw at this time.

Included at the top of this sheet is the coat of arms of the City of Edinburgh, along with the motto 'nisi dominus frustra' (all is in vain without the lord). To warrant this heartfelt remembrance, John Kennedy must have been a well-liked and popular figure around Edinburgh.

Such poems became popular in Scotland after the huge success of 'The Life and Death of Habbie Simson, Piper in Kilbarchan' by Robert Sempill of Beltrees (c.1595-1659). This introduced the 'Standard Habbie' verse form used here. Mock or comic elegies were written on fictional characters and real people, both dead and alive. In this example, the comedy derives from the highly insulting memorial to the apparently deceased Gray, and from the inclusion alongside it of an angry response form Gray, who, it transpires, is not dead after all!

This light-hearted elegy on a character called Gray paints a very damning picture of him indeed, and is accompanied by his own reply in which he protests his innocence over various allegations. Since elegies are typically a lament for the dead, Gray has managed a tremendous feat in replying to his! This particular elegy is written in the popular verse form known as 'Standard Habbie', in which the first, second, third and fifth lines have four beats and rhyme, and the fourth and sixth lines are of two beats and also rhyme.

This ballad is an epic song of mourning to a recently deceased minister, John Hamilton of Greyfriars Church in Edinburgh, who was clearly well-loved by his congregation. It would appear that Hamilton worked tirelessly for God, including a spell spreading the 'true faith' in Ireland. The reference to the 'savage natives' who live in Ireland is interesting.

George Paterson is thought to have begun his rock home in Drum Street, Gilmerton, in 1719 and finished sometime in 1725. He and his family dwelt there until long past his death probably in 1735, as the land was his by right. The whole complex consisted of numerous rooms, furnished with rock-hewn chattels, and focused on the huge forge. This was where Paterson eventually conducted his business from. It is now a tourist attraction open to the public as Gilmerton Cove.

The elegy is written in an acrostic form, where the first letter of every fifth line is boldly capitalised. Looking down the page, instead of horizontally, the words 'JAMES EARLE OF PERTH' are spelt. James was the 3rd Earl of Perth, and lived at Drummond Castle, his family seat. He died on 2nd June, 1675.

According to a note under the title, Thomas Smellie was the third son of the late William Smellie, F.R.S. & A.S.S.
It seems very likely that Thomas's father was the famous printer and antiquary, William Smellie (1740-1795). Whilst there is a wealth of information available on the life of William, little seems to have been written about his son, Thomas. Yet, to warrant this elegy, Thomas must have been a well-known and respected figure by the time of his death.
Edinburgh-born William Smellie was a founder member of the Society of Antiquaries (1780) and Keeper of the Edinburgh Museum of Natural History (1781). He is perhaps best remembered as the editor and publisher of the first edition of the 'Encyclopedia Britannica' (1799) and for his involvement in the publication of the first Statistical Account of Scotland.",Broadside entitled 'Elegy on Thomas Smellie',1810-1830

The elegy itself begins: 'O Curs'd Atropus, thou cancard Wife, / I wonder what aild thee to draw thy knife'. Unfortunately, the name of the publisher is not included.
This song of mourning is dedicated to the memory of Mrs McLeod, who was executed in Edinburgh in 1727, for the crime of counterfeiting. Although written in a fairly elevated and erudite tone with some classical allusions, the ballad is very much a character assassination of poor Mrs McLeod. The last few verses of the ballad focuses on the interaction that occurred on the scaffold between Mrs McLeod and the hangman, Doctor John Dalgeish. Many broadsides such as this one are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

It is possible that the Rev. William Dunn, Minister of Kirkintilloch, who is being mourned here, was the very same Dunn who was imprisoned for three months under the suspicion of an alleged association with the political agitator and staunch republican, Thomas Muir of Huntershill. Whether or not he is, it is apparent from this elegy that William Dunn was a popular man who would be sorely missed by his congregation.

This particular elegy mourns the death of the champion Scottish boxer, Sandy (Alexander) McKay, who died of a brain haemorrhage on the 3rd June, 1830. His injuries resulted from a boxing match against Symon Byrne (or Burn), the champion of Ireland, which took place at Salcey Green, Northamptonshire, on the 2nd June of the same year. Although arrested for McKay's murder, following a trial weighted in his favour, Byrne eventually walked free. He was defeated in a contest for the championship of England against Jem Ward in 1831. In 1833 he died at St. Albans after a fight with James 'Deaf' Burke.

The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection includes a large number of elegies, many of which lament the passing of local characters such as Wee Geordie. Whilst these individuals were obviously popular enough to warrant an elegy or lamentation, they have since been forgotten with the passing of years. It is obvious from this elegy that Wee Geordie was a familiar sight around Edinburgh, and was going to be sorely missed by many. In fact, an illustration of Geordie appears on another broadside advertising Mr Percival's Edinburgh-based artists' studio.

It is known that the Dr Rev. John Gillies published two volumes of historical information, but only because the more famous Dr Rev. John Erskine (1721-1803) published a supplement to the works. From these volumes it can be discerned that John Gillies was an advocate of 'faith through love'.

According to a note under the title, it was 'done by Rorie Pringle Drawer in the Tolbooth.'
Edinburgh's Old Tolbooth, once situated close to St Giles' Cathedral on the High Street, is believed to have been the main home of the Scottish parliament until the early seventeenth century. It also housed the town council and burgh court, and acted as the main prison for Edinburgh and its environs. Towards the end of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century it was primarily used as a prison. Sadly, the building, commonly known as the 'Heart of Midlothian', was demolished in 1817, but a heart-shaped design on the pavement marks the location of the entrance.

According to a note under the title, Sir Robert Blackwood died on the 24th April 1720.
It appears from this elegy that Robert Blackwood was sorely missed by the people of Edinburgh: 'Why should not Edinburgh with Tears be / For Loss of Him, who was their Stay and Shield. / For the Town's Good, and Trade's was still his Aim / And Charitable to All, who unto him did come.'

Eighteenth-century broadside elegies such as this one, used death as a public occasion for restating and reinforcing values of the community. The dead most often provided a moral lesson, serving either as an example of a good Christian death or as a warning to sinners. Bishop Ross is obviously in the former category and is hailed for his piety and humility.

David, 3rd Earl of Wemyss (b. 1678) married Anne Douglas in 1697 and they had two children, David and James. He remarried, to Mary Robinson, in 1708, and took a third wife, Elizabeth Sinclair, in 1716. They had two children together, Elizabeth and Margaret.

14998,courtship,L.C.Fol.70(64a),"This ballad begins: 'One dark and stormy night / The snow lay on the ground / A sailor boy stood on the quay / His ship was out ward bound . . . ' Below the title, we are told that this ballad 'Can be had at the Poet's Box, Dundee', and that it costs one penny.
This melancholic ballad tells the story of a departing sailor and his young sweetheart. The 'dark and stormy' night-time setting for their fond farewell at the harbour appears to be full of portent. The foreboding imagery employed in the ballad is shown to be prophetic, and the ship returns to port flying its flag at half-mast. Tragically, the sailor and his sweetheart were star-crossed lovers.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets.

There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

The National Library of Scotland holds another broadside relating to this case, 'Elegy on the Death of Nicol Muschet of Boghall', which gives a little more information regarding Muschet's fall from grace.

The broadside carries no publication details.
'Roslin Castle' is thought to have been written by Richard Hewitt of Cumberland (d.1764), secretary to the blind Scottish poet Thomas Blacklock (1721-91). It was a popular song, reproduced on many broadsides, and was commonly sung to an old Scottish pipe air known as 'The House of Glamis'. As a setting for a love song, Roslin Castle has an appropriate air of romance. Now a partial ruin, the fourteenth-century castle is sited spectacularly on a rocky promontory above the River Esk, in Midlothian.

This ballad was to be sung to an 'Original' tune and was priced at one penny. It was published  on Saturday, 9th March 1867, by the Poet's Box, probably in Glasgow.
This ballad is narrated by a young girl in praise of her gentle, handsome, impeccably-mannered suitor, Robin, whose only failing is that he is too shy to propose to her. The subject of courtship is portrayed differently here than in many other ballads, which feature young men determined to seduce their sweethearts without marrying them. Fashions of the age perhaps had some influence on the tone of ballads. In the eighteenth century it seems to have been more acceptable for men to appear as scoundrels than in the nineteenth century, when this broadside was published.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were.

The printer and supplier of this broadside are not identified, but at the foot of the page there is an advertisment for songbooks 'sent post free to any address for 7 stamps'.
The rituals and risks of courting were popular subjects for ballads. Here the courting theme is used for comic purposes. The ballad is narrated by a young man who uses the opportunity of having his mare shod to woo the blacksmith's daughter. The young couple flee on the back of the mare, pursued by the blacksmith. When he finally catches up with them however, the narrator pacifies the blacksmith by offering his mother in exchange for the blacksmith's daughter, a deal the blacksmith eagerly accepts.

' This ballad was to be sung to the tune of 'My Love Nell', and was published by the Poet's Box, Dundee.
Parted lovers featured often in ballads, and one of the most common reasons for separation was that the 'lad' had enlisted for the army, leaving his girlfriend at home. This ballad is a poignant variation on this theme. It is mainly narrated by Maggie, who is waiting for her sweetheart to return home from the army. In the opening verse she is 'as happy as a queen', but as the ballad unfolds, we learn that she has not had a letter from her Jock, and that she has heard he is courting someone else. At the end Jock does return, drunk, and barely notices her, yet despite her sadness Maggie remains devoted to him.

It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson. 
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

The phrase 'Ranty Tanty' has rather obscure origins. Read as one word it is the name for certain types of weed (one which grows red amongst corn and the other a broad-leaved docking) and the name of the drink distilled from it. Taken separately, however, the expression means a lively wrangle or a riotous, almost tipsy, argument. It went on to become a slang term for a prostitute during the 1800s. Similar lyrics can be found under the titles, 'Tow to Spine', 'Scorn fu' Nancy' and 'Nancy's to the green-wood gane'.

There are no publication details included on this sheet, although the author and commission details, more unusually, have been given. It would appear that the song was written by James Kerr, who may also be the un-named 'gent' in the song, to the 'farmer's daughter Nell' in the lyrics. The song may have been published to attract Nell's attention, as a celebration of their relationship. Perhaps the information was only included as a marketing ploy, to tug at the readers' heart-strings and lend an air of innocent romance to the sheet.

The chorus begins: 'Pretty Little Nell, the farmer's daughter / I met her at the well drawing water'. Included at the top of the sheet is a woodcut illustration of a young woman with a dog.
The first verse of 'Down Among the Coal' begins: 'JEMIMA lived in service once, at a house in St. Enoch Square, / She ne'er got out, so I used to go and cour her there'. The chorus begins: 'Down among the coals, down among the coals, / All alone and in the dark, I say boys, it is a lark'.
Whilst no publication details have been included on this sheet, the number '670' does suggest that it was published as part of a sequence. A number of broadside producers issued series in the hope that people would begin to collect them. This particular sheet would have probably sold well because of the inclusion of two ballads and a small illustration.

16029,courtship,L.C.1269(153a),"This ballad begins: 'Twas near the banks of bonny Tweed, / And in a flowery dell, / A rustic cottage reared its head, / The traveller knew it well; / For there a little lassie dwelt, / As fair as beauty's queen - / Not one so rare, not one so fair / As pretty Rosaline.' It was to be sung to an 'Original' tune, and was published on Saturday, 23rd December 1871 by the Poet's Box in Glasgow, priced one penny.
This tragic little song encompasses themes that were popular in the ballad tradition from the early, pre-printing days. The fall from innocence of a young woman was a common subject. The 'cruel lord' who is Rosaline's undoing in this ballad is also a familiar stock figure from the oral tradition. An Edenic pastoral setting into which evil is introduced features here and recurs in other ballads: nature is sometimes presented as evidence of God's goodness, sometimes as wild and arbitrary, and sometimes as both within the one song.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were.

'The Poor Forsaken Village Maid' tells the story of a village girl who is seduced and taken to live in a large town by her lover, but who is then abandoned when she falls pregnant. At the end the girl drowns herself and her baby. This ballad reflects, without condemning, the harsh presbyterian morality that prevailed in Scotland as late as the nineteenth century. It is implied that the girl cannot possibly return to her home village because of the shame it would bring her parents. Her suicide is presented as a tragic, but inevitable, consequence of her actions.

As the title suggests, this ballad is a parody of the popular song entitled the 'Laird o' Cockpen'. The original version is attributed to Lady Carolina Nairne (Carolina Oliphant) (1766-1845) and begins: 'The Laird o' Cockpen, he's proud and he's great, / His mind is ta'en up wi' the things o' the state'. Whilst the Laird o' Cockpen is proud and great in Lady Nairne's version, he is turned down by the object of his affection. In the parody, however, despite being poor and ragged, the Laird o' Cockpen is accepted as a suitable suitor and lives happily ever after.

The woodcut included above the title shows a wooded valley. At the bottom of the valley a uniformed man is being brutally attacked by both women and men, one of whom is on a horse.
This song tells the story of the strength of Mary's love for her Henry. He was a soldier who was called to India whilst they were courting. Mary then suggests that they marry, and she joins up as a boy in order to be spared the pain of parting. As a result, she has to witness Henry's death in India, upon which she commits suicide. Much as wifely devotion was a cherished characteristic in women during the Victorian period, this display of unfeminine behaviour would have been frowned upon. Nevertheless there are other stories of women who cross-dressed in order to enter a man's world.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The Paisley Officer',1860-1890

The broadside carries no publication details.
The notion of being willing to die for love has long been an element in romantic poems and songs, and is often found in broadside ballads. One way in which this devotion is manifested is in the idea of a woman disguising herself as a man so that she can stay by her husband's side when he goes to war. In some ballads the man insists that the woman stay at home, but in 'The Paisley Officer' the young bride does indeed disguise herself as a soldier, and she and her husband are both killed on the battlefield. The conflict referred to appears to be the First Indian War of Independence, or 'Indian Mutiny', which would date this ballad at later than 1857.

This ballad was probably quite popular with the audiences of its time as there are many occurrences of it the National Library of Scotland's collection. Certainly the elements of this story are adventures and emotive. The soldier, Henry, and meets, falls in love with and makes an honest woman of Mary. He is then posted elsewhere and rather than be parted from her lover, Mary cross-dresses and follows him. As result she has to witness his horrific death and then begin to rebuild her life. The climactic scene of the poem is reflected in the woodcut at the top of the page.

The broadside was published by the Poet's Box in Dundee. It does not carry a date of publication.
'On the Banks of Allan Water' is believed to have been written by Matthew Lewis (1775-1818), the English author, socialite and one-time member of parliament best known for his gothic novel 'The Monk'. Although Lewis was an Englishman, his song refers to a Scottish river, the Allan Water, which rises in the Ochil Hills and joins the Forth south of Bridge of Allan. The song became very popular and features in Thomas Hardy's 1874 novel 'Far From the Madding Crowd'.

The broadside was published for the author at the Minerva Printing Works, 80 London Street, Glasgow. It is not dated.
This broadside appears to be an example of a phenomenon popularly known as 'vanity publishing', where an author pays to have his or her work published. One of the best known so-called 'vanity publishers' was Minerva Press, which was established in London in 1810, and it appears that John Pettigrew had his songs published by a Glasgow branch of this press. As the financer and sole distributor, as well as the author, of this broadside, Pettigrew appears to have had a great say in the design of the sheet. Unusually, he has included a curriculum vitae at the foot of the page, to prove his credentials as a songwriter. Pettigrew also credits additional composers or performers where appropriate.

The River Allan, Perthshire, was a popular literary motif during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This song first and foremost is a poem of high drama and emotion which would probably have admirably entertained an audience. It is also used as a vehicle of social instruction though - as a warning to young men and women about their behaviour and other people's motives.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box.

It was printed by Robert M'Intosh, probably in Glasgow.
'Nothing More' is a romantic song with a strong moral subtext. The art of seduction was a common theme in ballads, and many end with a woman alone, broken-hearted and shamed in some way. In this example, however, the lovestruck narrator is restrained and patient, asking his sweetheart only for a flower, or a smile, or a kiss, and 'nothing more'. His gallantry is eventually rewarded when the girl he has wooed 'for weeks and months' consents to marry him.

The young man of this light-hearted ditty soon meets a young woman and proposes marriage on the grounds that they both have 'nothing else to do'. They then rush off to talk to a priest who agrees to marry them on the grounds that he has 'nothing else to do'. The song ends on a humorous and slighty risqué note, with the couple declaring that now they are married they 'will sing no more about it' as they have now 'got something else to do'. Tactfully, the 'something else' is left up to the imagination of the reader!

After humorously regaling his lover with the inventory of his father?s worldly possessions bequeathed to him, the young man adopts a serious tone as he states his love for Jenny. In response to hearing of this wealth, Jenny puts her hand in his hand and, symbolically, the 'he' and 'she' of the ballad change to 'they'.

The text of this ballad is bookended by advertisements for other songs that can be obtained at the Glagsow Poet's Box. Categories include 'sentimental, love, comic, sea, Jacobite, negro, and all other descriptions'. This indicates how popular broadside ballads still were, over two centuries after they were first published. It also reveals that music emerging from various historical developments over the intervening years, for example the slave trade or the Jacobite risings, had entered mainstream British society and broadened the definition of 'ballad'.

In the early days of broadside ballad publication, it is likely that the majority of ballads published in a certain area had their roots in or around that area. In this broadside from 1869, on the other hand, the text below the title explains that the song has been sung, by Albyn Buckley, at 'all the Principal Concert Halls in Britain'. Music halls became the premier form of light entertainment in Britain from the 1850s, and touring performers could become famous in their own right. It made commercial sense for broadside publishers in a certain area to produce copies of songs that had been performed locally by a popular visiting singer.

The National Library of Scotland has two other signed McGonagall poems, 'The Burial of Mr Gladstone' and 'The Blind Girl'. A note at the top states the poem was composed in September 1899.
William McGonagall (the 'Sir' is an affectation), was born around 1825 in Edinburgh. He started writing poetry in his late forties. He is remembered today chiefly for the awfulness of his poems. However, though mocked publicly in his lifetime, he never lost faith in his own genius. This self-belief could partly explain his enduring appeal. It is likely that McGonagall himself hawked this sheet. Broadside publications of his works were his main source of income. He died in 1902.
In his autobiography, McGonagall records that the honourary title 'Sir William Topaz McGonagall, Knight of the White Elephant, Burma' was awarded to him in a letter by King Theebaw of Burmah and the Andaman Islands. King Theebaw was a real person, although it seems likely the title was a cruel hoax, albeit one which McGonagall believed for the rest of his life.","Broadside publication of a poem entitled 'Nora, the Maid of Killarney'",1899

The question of whether it is wiser to marry for money or for love is at the heart of this popular song. This was a recurring theme in songs and novels in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The verses are narrated alternatingly by the 'sweet lass', who is already in love with a 'laddie', and the 'auld man', who is trying to tempt her with his 'gowd' or gold. The girl's determination holds firm in the end, and the broadside printer's sympathies also seem to lie with her, given the unflattering illustration of the 'auld man' on this broadside.

Laments and sentimental songs on the subject of leaving Scotland or Ireland are common around the world, as both these countries experienced high levels of emigration in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The National Library of Scotland holds a number of other sheets on the same theme, including The Irish Emigrant' and 'The Song of the Emigrant'.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

16554,courtship,RB.m.169(222),"This ballad begins: PEGGY's a maid both kind and fair / and Peggy is dear to Johnnie, / And none in all Scot'and here or there / None is so blythe and bonny'. The broadside was published by John Pitts at the Toy Warehouse, 6 Great St Andrew Street, in the Seven Dials area of London.
'Whistle my Love and I'll Come Down' is a Scottish ballad about the love between 'Peggy' and 'Johnny'. Peggy is a very idealised romantic heroine, who is beautiful, kind, musical and humble. The refrain 'And Peggy has vowed their love to crown / O whistle my love and I'll come down, / and gang to the church with Johnny' suggests that Peggy has agreed to marry Johnny, and will do so whenever he whistles. The whistle is a well-known roamantic sign that also features in the song 'Whistle and I'll Come To You, My Lad', by Robert Burns (1759-1796).

A woodcut illustration of a sailing vessel has been included above the title.
'William and Herriet' touches on the traditional theme of tragic love, which is to be found in many early ballads. Herriet's father, believing his daughter to be too good for her lover, insists she end the relationship. Herriet refuses and, disguised as a sailor, departs with William for foreign shores. Tragically, the two young lovers find themselves shipwrecked and stranded on an inhospitable island. The ballad ends with the doomed lovers dying in each others arms.

This sheet was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow. There is a woodcut illustration at the top of the sheet which depicts the Prince of Wales' crest.
Many of James Lindsay's sheets carry illustrations which are loosely connected to the text. This one shows the crest of the Prince of Wales. A likely explanation for this is that George Linley, the author of the poem, had strong associations with the Prince of Wales. He also wrote the famous song 'God Bless the Prince of Wales'. The first Prince of Wales crest was created in 1301, by Edward I. This crest was adopted during the middle of the fourteenth century by Edward's grandson, the Black Prince. The feathers were taken from his mother's, Phillipa of Hainault's, crest and the motto 'Ich diene', which means 'I serve', from the King of Bohemia. 
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day.

16030,courtship,L.C.1269(153b),"Verse 1: 'A charming young creature named Nancy Barr, / Nancy Barr, lived with her ma; / Of fair ones, oh! she was the fairest by far, / A charmer bewitching and smart. / No dicky-bird singing up in the sky, / In the sky. Was more happy than I, / But to happiness now I have said ""goodbye,"" / For to pieces she's broken my heart!' This song was to be sung to an 'Original' tune, and was published on Saturday, 4th December 1869, by the Poet's Box in Glasgow, priced at one penny.
'Where is my Nancy?', which is narrated by a man who has been left at the altar by his prospective bride, should be a sad affair. Instead, the rhyme-scheme and vocabulary the author has chosen turn it into a funny, lively song. The repetition in the first and second and fifth and sixth lines commits the poet to finding internal rhymes, and sometimes these verge on the nonsensical, for example 'Love at first sight, lumps of delight' or 'My heart went wop, and flippity flop'. This seems to be a deliberate move by the author to make the narrator a figure of fun.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

The broadside was published by McIntosh of 96 King Street, Calton, Glasgow. It is illustrated with a woodcut of a Scottish soldier.
'The Wanderer' is a very popular title for ballads, and reflects the romantic connotations that travelling often has in literature, music and art, and also the theme of separation which is common in love songs and poems. This broadside is a folk derivative of the song ""Cease a while ye winds to blow,"" published by J. C. Bach in ""The Third collection of favorite songs sung at Vaux-Hall"" (London: Welcker, [1771]).  The source of the lyric is unknown.  The lyric used by 'London' Bach was printed in ""Vocal Music, or the Songster's Companion"" (London: J. Bew, 1778?) and later compendia, and was set in four parts by the American composer Jacob French, to a tune he named ""Attention,"" in ""New American Melody"" (Boston: John Norman, 1789). 
Usually the 'wanderer' or traveller in such songs is a man, who has joined the armed forces or gone away to look for work or simply to experience the world, and the narrator is a bereft woman left at home. In this example, the female narrator is listening for her lover to come home, and begins to fear that he may have been lost in a storm.

Although no publication date is included, the sheet was published by Menzies of Edinburgh.
This highly unusual broadside explores the theme of romantic love, but in the complicated form of a word puzzle. Unfortunately, it is not clear how the middle section of this word puzzle, or conundrum, should be read. It would appear, however, that the reader can pick and mix the set expressions included in the three columns, thereby producing new and original lines of romantic poetry for the object of his or her desire.

It was during the 1840s and 1850s that the numbers of Irish immigrants into Glasgow began to increase, to the point where the city authorities are recorded as having sent many of them back. With regular sailings between Belfast, Derry and Glasgow, this passage was cheaper to fund than that to the Americas and so it was often the only option for the poor and destitute. The topic of this sheet is perhaps meant to appeal to this section of the audience.

Although the date of publication is not included, a note at the foot of the sheet states that it was 'Published by W. SMITH, No. 3, Bristo Port', which is an Edinburgh address.
This broadside contains a light-hearted story that was written to entertain its audience, by playing on the old maxim that the route to a man's heart is through his stomach. Thus, we have a situation whereby two servant girls invite their boyfriends in for a meal. However, it seems that their masters, a minister and his wife, do not approve of servants having their friends visit them. So when the minister's wife appears unexpectedly, a whole series of comic episodes occur, as the girls try to hide their suitors in the house. The ailments that afflict the two suitors as a result of their adventure, could be interpreted as a mild moral warning to servants to improve their conduct.

Broadside ballads were cheap and easily accessible. They were often sold for a penny a sheet and covered topics which would have been instantly recognisable to the general population, such as love, marriage and poverty. They were also often used as a moral forum with 'lessons' of life included in the narrative. They were only printed on one side so that they could be pasted to walls and in this way enjoyed, momentarily and in the passing, by many people.

It was published by James Lindsay of Glasgow, and probably sold for one penny.
This song touches on one of the most common themes found in the traditional folk ballad, that of tragic love. The unfortunate shepherdess of the title laments the murder of her young lover, the shepherd, at the hands of her father. As he is lying bleeding, he pledges his small flock to her with the promise that 'They'l be your companions thro' hail wind and snow'. His dying words prove to be true and despite the eventual death of her estranged father and the promise of a rather large inheritance, the young woman relinquishes her birthright and vows to wander the hills 'till death ends the strife, / Lamenting my shepherd all the days of my life'.

Robert Burns included this song in his selection for the 'Scots Musical Museum'. In a private set of accompanying notes he revealed his lyrics had been written by James Tytler of Edinburgh but the first two lines were taken from an older fragmentary song.

The sheet was printed on the Saturday morning of November 27th, 1869, and cost one penny.
Written from the viewpoint of a woman, this romantic ballad tells of her love for a sweetheart who lives far away from her. This subject of parted lovers pining for their other half is a common theme in broadside ballads, and one that would have been familiar to many Scots during the age when so many people emigrated from the country. Living on her fond memories of the past, the woman has not yet abandoned all hope of a reunion with her lover, and the ballad closes on this unresolved note of loving faith.

This is a comic song that takes a popular romantic ballad premise, the narrator whose lover has forsaken him or her, and introduces grotesque or nonsensical images that reduce the apparent tragedy of the song to farce. The first verse could almost be taken seriously, but after this the verses become increasingly ridiculous. In verse two, the narrator describes as one of Jenny's most beautiful features the fact that she 'squints with one eye'; in verse five, he searches for her up a chimney; and finally, in verse seven, there is comic pathos when the apparently suicidal narrator bids farewell to 'the moo-cows so brown'.

The address of the publisher has been obscured on this broadside, although an advertisement for another of its publications, 'The Ball-Room Companion', has been left intact.
This ballad is narrated by a young woman who apparently has a romantic dilemma. In the first verse, she describes three men who are 'teasing' her, and suggests that she does not know which one she loves the best. Carl, the wealthy clan chief, gets all of verse two to himself. Ultimately, however,  in verse three, the narrator realises she loves her 'Jamie' and vows to marry him 'tho his siller store be sma''. The question of whether it is better to marry for money or for love is one that recurs in ballads, and more often than not, love wins.

As this broadside contains four ballads, the pedlars - or chapmen - who sold these publications to the general public would have marketed it as a wonderful bargain. The two ballads on the left hand side are all about drinking alcohol and making toasts of undying loyalty to the king. The third ballad, meanwhile, is a celebration of the martial qualities of famous Scottish figures from the past. Employing warm imagery from nature to create a favourable setting, the fourth ballad is a romantic description of two eloping lovers arranging a secret rendezvous.

This song is based on the common phenomenon of young children making heroes of those a few years older than them.

The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s.

The narrator of this rather sad, but intentionally humorous, tale alternates between verse and spoken form to recount the tragic details of his short voyage aboard the steamship, the 'Bumbee'. After a string of unfortunate events, the narrator appears inconsolable when he finally loses his sweetheart to the captain of the steamship. The name of the accompanying melody is not provided on this sheet, only that the song was to be sung to the original tune.

The narrator presents the loss of his sweetheart as a great tragedy but little details in the telling, particularly in the spoken sections, render the tale increasingly ridiculous. The whole premise of the song - that the lives of a whole ship's crew and passengers are endangered by a storm during a romantic cruise down the Paisley Canal - marks the song out as farce. It was probably written for performance in a music hall or pub.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson. 
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

This broadside ballad contains a love song dedicated to Mary, 'The Star of Glengary'. As both lovers are shown to be in tune with nature, it is likely that this ballad was written during the Romantic era, in the latter part of the eighteenth century. The red moon eclipse mentioned in the opening line is probably a pagan symbol of female fertility. Glengarry is located between Loch Ness and Loch Lochy, in the heart of the Scottish Highlands' Great Glen.

Edinburgh?s Bridewell was situated on Regent Road, to the west of the Jail. It was different to a jail because attempts were made to reform inmates through hard labour. It was the last public building designed by Robert Adam (1728-92), and opened in 1790, at which time it held 70 felons. In 1865 the distinction between jails and bridewells was abolished.

Illustrated with two dramatic woodcuts of manacled prisoners boarding a ship, then of people working in a new land, this broadside claims to be a letter written by someone who, though originally from Edinburgh, was transported to a plantation in Australia. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing if John Paterson was in fact the writer of this highly erudite letter. Whatever, with its descriptions of floggings, chain-gangs and frequent executions, the letter certainly makes a strong case for penal reform. Conversely, it could instead be argued that this sheet represents a form of social control, since it highlights the effectiveness of transportation as a dreaded punishment.

This broadside starts with a long list of the high-ranking judges who constituted the Special Commission that presided over this trial. The very fact that it is called a 'Special Commission', highlights the great sensitivity surrounding this trial. The charge facing the two accused men is that they were part of a mob that deliberately stopped production of a cotton works in Johnston, near Paisley. In short, the men are on trial for carrying out a strike. With a crowd of 10,000 gathered outside the courtroom, it is not surprising that the men were eventually found not guilty. The list of the jurymen's occupations reveals much about the main industry in Paisley at this time.

This is an example of a news story being used by a broadside publisher for the purposes of moral instruction. Accounts of executions were often heavy in moralising, but this is a slightly more unusual case. The story is that of a young girl who commits suicide after being falsely accused of stealing money from her master. One feature that stands out from the story is the willingness of the police to take the girl prisoner purely on her employer's instructions. Today, firmer grounds for suspicion would probably be required.

Although he did not actually kill anyone, Thomas Hay's crime was considered particularly shocking by the broadside writers of the time, as it was apparently premeditated and entirely unprovoked. In a reference that shows how efficient at communication the British newspaper and broadside media was even in 1824, Hay's crime is compared to that of the murderer John Thurtell, who was hanged the same year in Elstree, Hertfordshire.

This broadside is almost identical to the court round-up features that appear in today's newspapers. The sheet starts by headlining the most sensational court cases, then lists the more mundane trials and sentences. Theft and housebreaking offences appear most frequently in the list, with transportation being the sentence that is usually handed down by the judge. The aim of the 'Criminal Code' (known as the 'Bloody Code' in England) in Scotland was to protect property and to provide the Establishment with cheap labour - hence the transportation sentences for theft. the 'Criminal Code' in Scotland lasted from about 1660 to 1850.

Following this opening section, the sheet proceeds to describe in detail a break-in to a shop that occurred.

The outcome of the case, was that Joseph was found guilty and his brother Maxwell not - a little odd as, according to the statements, the two men were always seen together. Joseph was then imprisoned in Stranraer to await his execution. It would appear from this article that Joseph also had two sons, who were also involved, although to what extent is unclear.

It was published in Edinburgh in February 1824.
The method of murder used by Thomas Hay would probably suggest pychopathic tendencies to a modern criminal investigator. It is claimed that Hay 'fitted up his inner room as a human slaughter-house' before going out with the intention of luring a victim to his house where an unprovoked attempted murder took place. In the report, comparisons are made to a notorious murder of 1824, carried out in Elstree, Hertfordshire by John Thurtell.

The mention of the dreaded death sentence in the subtitle to this broadside would have been cleverly employed by the chapmen to grab the public's interest and thus increase sales. On reading the sheet, however, the audience would soon have discovered that it is in fact a court roundup listing many crimes and names. Most of the cases recorded here deal with theft, robbery and housebreaking, with transportation usually being the subsequent sentence. Sadly, one of the death sentences meted out is to a William Moore who, at only 17, is already a thief of some reputation.

This broadside reports on a murder trial in which a mother was accused of killing her nine-year-old daughter, then flinging her body into a nearby river. Although the mother pleaded not guilty and the jury returned an ambiguous not proven verdict, the accused was held in jail so that a full investigation could be carried out. The reason for her further detainment was the behaviour of her six-year-old son, who had run away because of the mother's harsh treatment of her children.

On trial were a collier and a weaver from Ayr, who, while under the influence of alcohol, were found guilty of murdering a man who was returning from a religious ceremony. After the pronouncement of the death sentence, the writer focuses on the demeanour of the men as they face up to the enormity of what confronts them.

The ballad begins: 'O my son, why did you wander, / Why so far away from home'. Although there are no publication details included on this sheet, the subject matter suggests that it was almost certainly published in Edinburgh, in 1829. To the left of the ballad is an eye-witness report, describing how a Glasgow mob pelted William Hare's wife with stones.
Although the headline to this sheet claims that the ballad was written by the mother of one of Burke and Hare's victims, it is far more likely to have been written by a broadside scribe. As highlighted in the adjoining story to this ballad, the public was in a vengeful mood at this time, with mob hysteria occurring in several Scottish cities - though especially so in Edinburgh. Continuing the female perspective, the adjacent news story tells of how Mrs Hare, after escaping the rage of the mob, eventually caught a steam-ship back to her native Ireland, but ended up living the cursed life of a wandering outcast.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites. The term 'ballad' eventually applied more broadly to any kind of topical or popular verse.","Broadside ballad entitled 'Lines Supposed to have Been Written by Mrs Wilson, Daft Jamie's Mother'",1829

The sheet cost threepence to buy, and was published by Glass of 9 South Niddry Street, Edinburgh.
Broadsides were generally priced at one penny. The higher charge for this sheet was probably justified by the considerable length of its text and the fact that its woodcut portraits appear to have been custom-made. This attention to detail, and the apparent willingness of people to pay more for it, also reflects the huge interest there was in the case of Burke and Hare. Anatomical dissection was regarded by many as an unnatural, ungodly practice, and when it was discovered that Burke and Hare had been inspired to multiple murder by the demands of anatomists for bodies, the outcry in Edinburgh was great.
Burke and Hare were Irish bodysnatchers and murderers, who worked around Edinburgh's Canongate area, eventually becoming local legends. They hit upon the idea of murdering solitary or vulnerable people (in an attempt not to get caught) so that they could sell the bodies for dissection.

Jamie Wilson, or 'Daft Jamie', was the penultimate victim of the notorious murderers Burke and Hare, who killed sixteen times on the streets of Edinburgh to provide the anatomist Robert Knox with bodies for medical research. Daft Jamie's murder is commonly believed to have been the pair's undoing. Whereas Burke and Hare had previously chosen mainly solitary and elderly victims, Jamie was a well-known character in Edinburgh's Old Town, and was immediately missed by his widowed mother. His corpse, when unveiled at a medical demonstration, was recognised by several of the participating students.

The writer of this ballad has tried to imagine the sort of nightmares that might have haunted Hare in the aftermath of his crimes. Vivid images, of Hare imagining the flesh falling off one if his victims, or of another vctim appearing to him as an angel, contribute to a poem that depicts Hare as a man who will be constantly  tormented by his deeds until his death and inevitable damnation.

Hare, equally as guilty as his accomplice Burke, escaped punishment by turning King's Evidence in return for his freedom. His fate was not quite as golden as promised, however. He travelled around Scotland for awhile but the case was so well known and caused such outrage, that there were riots when appeared. He is then believed to have lived in poverty in London for some time and he may even actually have died there possibly as late as 1860, rather than in his native Ireland in 1841.

William Burke and William Hare are among the most notorious criminals in Scotland's history. Having moved to Scotland from Ireland to work as labourers on the Grand Union canal, they began grave-robbing to provide anatomy lecturers with bodies for medical research and demonstration. Subsequently they turned to murder to acquire bodies, and were arrested only after they had killed sixteen times. Hare was spared the gallows by agreeing to give evidence against Burke, whose execution is described vividly in this broadside.

The term 'burked' refers to being murdered for the purposes of dissection. To avoid the presence of suspicious wounds, and to leave the body intact, the preferred method used by those committing the burking was suffocation. The term came into being after the notorious case of William Burke and William Hare in the early nineteenth-century. Both men engineered a scheme whereby they supplied fresh bodies for dissection using murderous means. Although William Burke was hanged for his crimes, William Hare agreed to appear as a King's Witness in return for his freedom.

The writer of this ballad sensationally claims to have heard this condemned cell confession of William Burke's, while walking past the jail at Calton Hill, in Edinburgh. A rather tall tale, it is far more likely that the writer caught his amazing 'scoop' by unleashing his imagination on what Burke might be thinking, prior to his execution. Illustrated with a foreboding woodcut of William Burke, in the ballad 'Burke' admits his guilt and begs the ultimate judge, God, to show him mercy. As religion dominated Scottish life at this time, the fate of what would happen to the eternal soul was of utmost importance.

William Burke is known to have made two detailed confessions between his trial in December 1828 and his execution, and a transcription of one of these confessions is reproduced on this broadside. Burke insists that his only accomplice was Hare. Burke's common-law wife, Helen McDougal, was tried with him for one of the murders, but was released on a 'not proven' verdict.

This broadside tells of how a mob stormed an anatomical theatre in Aberdeen, following the discovery of a body outside its doors. As news spread of the crimes committed by Burke and Hare in Edinburgh, suspicion of medical schools and surgeons became rife. Indeed, as can be seen from the title of this broadside, the words 'Burking' and 'Burke' even entered the lexicon, thus immortalising the villains. Given that the bodies of executed prisoners were sent to medical schools for dissection, it is interesting to note that people held such an ambiguous attitude towards medical schools and anatomical theatres.

The rest of the broadside is written in verse. This is a very early warning about a practice that was to become increasingly common in the late eighteenth century, that of grave robbing to provide fresh cadavers for dissection.

There was a horror throughout the nineteenth century of having one's body dissected. This was inflicted upon those sentenced to execution as a further punishment.

Whilst this ballad pays homage to Ireland, it also bemoans the traitors of Erin who, through bad legislation, brought the country to its knees. As a result of agricultural policies that favoured the rights of landowners over tenant farmers, poverty and starvation became mainstays of agricultural life in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Ireland.
In the second verse of the ballad, the line 'In the midst of plenty some thousands are starving' could be referring to the Irish potato famine of the late 1840s, during which hundreds of thousands of Irish peasants died after the failure of the potato crop, and many more emigrated to escape a smiliar fate. The tragic irony of these years is that while people were dying from starvation, plentiful supplies of wheat, oats, barley and meat were being exported from Ireland. A broadside dealing with such issues would have proved extremely popular with the thousands of Irish immigrants who had settled in Scotland.",Broadside ballad entitled 'A True Son of Erin's Lament for Ireland',1852-1859

The broadside was published by Robert McIntosh of 96 King Street, Calton, in Glasgow. Although it is not dated it is likely to have been published in the mid-nineteenth century, when McIntosh is known to have had premises at this address.
'Woman's Pride' was probably written as a comic ballad with a cautionary message. It is a satirical attack on women who wear fashionable or elaborate hairstyles, mocking their 'false silly curls' and accusing them of vanity and extravagance. To a modern audience this song is deeply misogynistic, but ballads with similar sentiments were quite common in Victorian Britain. During that period there was a significant school of thought that believed women, particularly if married, should embrace a very domesticated, family-orientated role, and reject a showy social identity.

There are directions for these lyrics to be sung to the tune 'Britain's sons never were afraid'. This sheet was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow. Lindsay worked from these premises during the 1850s.
It was during this period that there was an unstable balance of power between France and Britain, which was being acted out on the Iberian Peninsula. What had started in the late 1820s as a strong Franco-British alliance for mutual gain in Spain and Portugal was, by this time, soured by suspicion and ambition. As a result, Britain lost much of the political influence it had gained in Spain and suffered continual military defeats there. There are other broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection which deal with Franco-British politics during this period.

The sheet carries no publication details.
This broadside is not dated, but certain details in the ballad suggest that it was written in the mid 1850s. The line 'Old Aberdeen, in the House of Lords, knock'd down Lord Stanley right slap' refers to George Hamilton Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen (1784-1860), replacing Edward Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby (1799-1868), as prime minister in 1852. The final three verses suggest that the poem was composed during the Crimean War (1854-56). The 'stagnation' probably refers to a decline in the textiles industry which badly affected Scotland from about 1840. Economic recovery in the second half of the nineteenth century was helped by growth in the iron and shipbuilding industries.

This song is a call to arms inspired by the First Indian War of Independence, known in Britain as the Indian Mutiny, which began in 1857. Britain had established trading stations in India through the British East India Company in the early seventeenth century, and India was recognised as part of the British Empire by the Treaty of Paris in 1763. The causes behind the war of 1857 were complicated, but at its root lay the British colonists' increasing interference in Indian traditions and beliefs. As the Indian side was made up mainly of sepoys, Indian soldiers who had served in the British Army, Britain had to recruit new troops from the home nations, hence the words of this song. The British, displaying a brutality that became infamous, were eventually victorious.

The 'Sir Colin' referred to in the text is Sir Colin Campbell who lead the 93rd Regiment, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, into battle at Balaclava in 1854. Their brave, unorthodox and successful single line stance - the 'thin red line' -  instead of a square, against the Russian's cavalry charge, delighted the British public and ensured their lasting fame. Previous to this the 93rd were stationed in Canada, the West Indies and after this, in 1855, they went on to distinguish themselves in India.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day. Cheaply available, they were sold on the streets by pedlars and chapmen.

As with many traditional nursery rhymes and songs there are numerous versions of this song in existence, although the repetition of 'pop goes the weasel' is generally found in each. Its origins are shrouded in mystery, with some claiming that it is an English rhyme dating back to the seventeenth or eighteenth century and others suggesting a possible American influence. Whilst the meaning of the song has also created a certain amount of discussion, it does seem clear that there was a popular dance of the same name. This has long been a favourite song amongst both adults and children and would have very likely sold well as a broadside.

This song was to be sung to its original tune and would have cost a penny to buy. It was published by the Poet's Box (probably Glasgow) but the accompanying address has been burnt out of the sheet. It was issued on Saturday 1st October, 1870.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

This song was printed on other broadsides, held in the National Library of Scotland's collection, indicating its popularity. During the late eighteenth century highland figures were romanticised and a literary motif of rolling a girl in a highlander's plaid to claim her was established. Perhaps this reflected an aspect of social behaviour at the time. This rather racy song discusses a woman's folly at choosing a poor and almost uncouth highlander, who in reality cannot provide for her - a stern social warning to other prospective brides.

The ballad was to be sung 'To an Excellent New Tune'. The top of the broadside is illustrated with woodcuts, the first showing one man extending the hand of friendship to another, the second showing an armed man on horseback.
The story of this ballad is summed up in a short prose preface: 'Giving a true account of a Nobleman, who taking Notice of the poor man's Industrious Care and Pains for the maintaining of his charge, which was Seven small Children, meeting with him upon a day, Discoursed with him, and invited him and his Wife, with his Children, Home to his House; and accordingly bestowed upon him a Farm of Thirty Aikers of Land, to be continued to him and his Heirs.' The ballad, in rhyming couplets, is narrated mainly in the third person but also contains verses of dialogue between the nobleman and the countryman.

Bowie is inscribed to Wallace Bruce, the American Consul at Edinburgh and Theodore Napier of Magdala, President of the Scottish National Association of Victoria. It was published on the 24th June 1893, by C. Harvey of Stirling.
The Battle of Bannockburn was fought just outside of Stirling on the 23rd and 24th of June 1314, between Robert Bruce and Edward II. This was to end a long period of English occupation in Scotland's power centres. The battle itself is still at the centre of a great controversy. Bruce had 7,000 men who, although adept at guerrilla warfare, were no match for Edward's 20,000 battle-trained troops. Despite this, the Scots won an outright and resounding victory and Edward was almost taken prisoner.

Although this ballad bears no attribution, it is purported to be by Francis Sempill (c.1616-1682) of Beltrees, Renfrewshire. Francis was also responsible for such works as 'The Blythsome Bridal' and 'The Banishment of Povertie'. The reference to 'Habbie Simpson' in the final verse was in recognition of the popular ballad, 'The Life and Death of Habbie Simpson, Piper in Kilbarchan', which was written by Francis' father, Robert Sempill (c.1595-c.1665).

This song, with its almost indecipherable lyrics, is a send up of Highlanders, their Highland English and their Gaelic phrasing. At this time a line of industrialisation was beginning to form and society was demarcating the north and south. Highlanders were represented as rural, 'simple' people whereas southern 'townies' were portrayed as a little more sophisticated. Many of the factual reports on broadsides, also contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection, comment as to whether a person is a Gaelic or English speaker and normally his job is also mentioned.

Below the title we are told that 'Copies of this Popular Reading can always be had the POET'S BOX, Overgate, Dundee'. 'Jo' means 'dear' and 'deave' means 'to worry'.
This light-hearted ballad, a parody on the work by Robert Burns, contains a waspish dialogue between a husband and his wife. The narrative perspective of the ballad shifts in each verse, from John Anderson to his unnamed wife, with the insults flying fast and furious. The writer lets the wife have the last word of the argument, where she ironically contrasts John?s insults with the ?sweet honeyed wirds? that he deployed when he was wooing her. In short, this ballad is a tongue in cheek account of how some relationships can turn stale after a while.

This comic song takes the form of an argument between a man and a wife over whether it is a mouse or a rat that has just scampered past them. The argument grows increasingly fierce and animated until Tibbie hits Johnnie over the head with her soup spoon and chases him off to bed, throwing his bowl after him. In the morning it turns out that the object they both glimpsed was a child's ball. Marriage was a popular theme in ballads, sometimes being portrayed comically, as in this poem, sometimes romantically, and sometimes as a social and moral contract where both parties had clearly-defined roles.

This humorous song deals with the subject of drinking tea. It is sent out as a warning to all husbands, advising them not to interfere with the tea-drinking habits of their wives. If they refuse to take heed of this warning, the song lays testament to what can happen.

One night, while Jock is out drinking, his mother does not prepare the nightly meal. Instead, she washes some 'mutches' or 'caps' and places them in the unused can to soak overnight.

Certainly, Jock appears to be very proud of wearing the regimental tartan - a fact which suggests that this ballad was written after 1822, when the wearing of tartan was no longer perceived to be a threat to the British nation-state.

'Dumblain' is an archaic spelling of Dunblane in Perthshire. 'Jessy the Flower of Dumblain' is not the only song to use that spelling of the town's name in its title: Sir Walter Scott's first novel 'Waverley' refers to a song entitled 'Bob of Dumblain'. 'Jessy . . .', is narrated by a man in praise of the woman he loves, and compares her favourably with all the most beautiful aspects of nature. It is quite a conventional romatic song, of a kind that was popular and frequently printed on broadsides.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing.

'Jessifield' is a ballad about a harsh prison, narrated by an ex-prisoner. Although the ballad's place of origin is not given on the broadside, it is likely that it refers to a prison that stood on the current site of Her Majesty's Young Offender's Institution, Dumfries, one mile west of Dumfries town centre. A prison has stood on the site since at least 1852, and the current institution is still known locally as Jessiefield.

'Ky' are 'cows'. This sheet was printed by W. Shepherd, Overgate, Dundee and priced at one penny. It was available to buy from the Poet's Box, which also had premises in the Overgate.
This song is referring to the Siege of Lucknow (1857), which was one of a series of sieges and battles collectively known as the Indian Mutiny of 1857-8. Disillusioned with British rule in India, large numbers of Indian soldiers, or 'sepoys', rose up in protest. Almost ninety days into the siege at the British Residency in Lucknow, Sir Henry Havelock and the forces under his command managed to break through the revolt and enter. Despite their efforts, the siege continued for a futher two months until the arrival of a Highland Regiment led by Sir Colin Campbell. It is claimed their arrival was heralded by the sound of bagpipes playing 'Auld Lang Syne'. Jessie Brown is purported to have been the wife of a British soldier stationed at Lucknow.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

The second ballad begins: 'As I went out a walking one morning in May, / I met a pretty Irish girl by chance upon the way'. The third ballad begins: 'Begone dull care, I prithee begone from me, / Begone dull care, for you and I shall never agree'. The sheet carries no publication details. It is illustrated with two woodcuts.
Of the three songs included here, by far the best known is 'Begone Dull Care'. The song was reprinted and anthologised many times and is still performed today. It has been traced back to at least the time of James VII and II (r.1685-89) but it is believed to be based on a French chanson that predates this. There are several songs known as 'Irish Molly O', and the one included on this sheet is not one of the better known versions.
This broadside was probably sold for a penny or a penny and a half. The inclusion of three ballads, and the woodcut illustrations, would probably have led to it being considered very good value at the time of its publication. Broadsides usually contained only one song or story and often featured little or no decoration.","Broadside ballads entitled 'Jessie o' the Dell', 'Irish Molly O' and 'Begone Dull Care'",1850-1870

This sheet is dated Saturday the 26th April, 1884, and was priced at one penny.
The accompanying air is said to be the 'Original', suggesting people were already familiar with this particular song and melody. The location of the railway station in 'Jessie at the Railway Bar' occasionally varies, with one version placing the events in Moorgate station rather than Brighton station. With no copyright laws in place at this time, publishers were able to reproduce and alter at will existing material without any legal repercussions.

The name of the publisher is not included and the sheet is not dated. A 'bawbee' was a 'halfpenny' and a 'birk' was 'a smart youth'.
The light-hearted verses contained in this broadside tell the story of the various men who try to woo Jenny and her bawbee. Written in a humorous manner, the story tells of a procession of upper-class men who all want to lay claim to Jenny?s Bawbee. However, Jenny is a canny lass and is not to be fooled by these fine and upstanding gentlemen who wish to marry her. Instead, Jenny falls for the very last man in this procession of suitors, Johnny. In contrast to his rivals, Johnny is poor in material terms but rich in other respects - hence the ballad is a comment on the nature of love.

The lyrics to this piece refer to piping water into a city from St Mary's Loch. The most famous loch with this name, is the freshwater loch between Selkirk and Moffat, in the Scottish Borders. Unfortunately, there seems to be some disquiet over the quality of the water the homes are receiving. The 'Canongate' is mentioned, which suggests that the 'City' was Edinburgh. The tune to the song is very popular on broadsides and so may have been fairly well known at the time.

This ballad was to be sung to an 'Original' tune, was priced at one penny and was published on Saturday, 30th December 1865 by the Poet's Box, probably in Glasgow.
The sentiments of this song are fairly typical of what might be expected even today at a Scottish New Year or Hogmanay party. Nostalgic memories, the passing of time, partings and reunions, and high hopes for the future are all elements in this song, just as they are in the more eloquent, most famous Hogmanay song of all, 'Auld Lang Syne'. In particular, the images of braes and trees in the third verse here appear to have been inspired directly by Burns's adaptation of 'Auld Lang Syne', the version most commonly sung today.

George I of Great Britain and Ireland (reign: 1714-27) succeeded to the British throne after the death of Queen Anne. A German prince of the House of Hanover, George was supported by the Whig party, which was opposed to the restoration of the deposed Stuart family to the British throne. George's German mannerisms and percived greed were widely unpopular in Britain, however. This poem, although ostensibly laudatory, in fact seems to be mocking the King with over-extravagant, insincere praise.

There are no publication details given, but this is one of two songs - printed by James Lindsay - on this sheet. 
This light-hearted ballad revolves around the issue of a curfew during courtship. Jeanie's father has decided that 10.30 is a suitable deadline for her returning home. Not convinced by this, Jeanie makes a mockery of her father's rule. Her brilliant and mischievous idea of stopping the clock is eventually uncovered by the 'craw o' the cock', which signifies the morning. The familiar theme of courtship and, most importantly, its trials and tribulations would have proved popular reading amongst the broadside-buying public. Since storytelling began, people have always favoured stories that provide them with at least one character or scenario they can easily identify with.

This rather amusing tale would no doubt have had its audiences laughing by its conclusions. Jean and the narrator first meet in a pub, which they are informed will shut at 10:30. Rather than miss out on the opportunity to spend together, Jean stops the clock in the pub and nobody realises until the cocks crow! Unusually for broadside literature this tale has a happy end. The couple marry and are happy with their choice!
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day.

It was to be sung to the tune 'Whole Hog or None'. The broadside was priced at one penny and published by the Poet's Box, 79 London Street, Glasgow, on Saturday, 8th February, 1879. However, another date on the sheet, reading 'D.-2-11-1872', indicates that this is a reprint of an older ballad.
'The Hale Rick-Ma-Tick' provides a fascinating snapshot of the issues that concerned Glaswegians in 1872, when this poem was originally written. The narrator condemns the cruelty of the wars of German unification which ended in 1871, and warns against Russian military aggression. The marriage of Queen Victoria's daughter, Princess Louise, to the Scots Marquess of Lorne, is celebrated. On a more parochial level, the narrator laments the absence of a tribute to Burns among the new statues that have been erected in Glasgow's George Square.

The sheet was published by William Shepherd of the Poet's Box, Dundee, and cost a penny.
The song is not particularly distinctive or unusual, but the sheet is very interesting for the additional information it gives about ordering songs from the Dundee Poet's Box. Apparently, for just 2d in stamps, they will send out 'ALMOST ANY SONG YOU WANT'. This is qualified by the assertion that if your song is not in stock, they will send a book containing 'nearly all the latest Songs and Ballads of the day'. Presumably then, for a further 2d you could have a song of your choosing!

This ballad was to be sung to the tune 'Gloomy Winter's now awa'. The sheet does not carry any publication details.
'Gardner Tammy' is a simple song about a young man who has died, apparently from a broken heart. Like many broadside ballads it was written to be sung to a pre-existing tune, described as being the tune of 'Gloomy Winter's now awa' by the Paisley weaver poet Robert Tannahill (1774-1810). However, this tune also predates Tannahill's song. It was arranged for 'Gloomy Winter's now awa' by Tannahill's regular arranger and composer R.A. Smith, but authorship of the melody has been attributed to both the violinist Nathaniel Gow (1766-1831) and Alexander Campbell (1764-1824).

This satirical ballad is a parody of one of Robert Burns's most well-known and popular songs, 'Comin' thro' the rye'. As the title suggests, it is written in the style of a mock lamentation, in which 'Learmonth' decries the treatment he has received at the hands of the electorate. Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1832) and owner of the Dean Estate, John Learmonth stood for election as a Tory member of parliament for Edinburgh in the mid-nineteenth century.

This song was published by the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee.
This ballad is a fairly unremarkable story of a girl who is in love with a soldier named Edwin. The girl, Jane, has vowed to marry Edwin despite being kept locked away from him by her parents for a year. Edwin asks her to consider the risks of being a soldier's wife and of risking her parents' love, but Jane is determined and the two eventually marry. Sentimental, conventional love tales like this were quite common in broadside ballads.

It was published by the Poet's Box, in December 1866. The place of publication has been erased but it is just possible to make out that the sheet came from 80 London Street, Glasgow.
It is believed that this song was written by a Dr Coates around 1841. The tune was written by Henry Russell (1812-1900), who also composed 'A Life on the Ocean Wave'. The song is very well-composed, its lyrics show thought and feeling for the poor woman who has to watch her child die while her husband gambles all their money away.

Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

As such, publishers often disseminated 'educational' texts outlining the social and personal consequences of undisciplined or immoral behaviour.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The Gambler's Wife',1866

This ballad was to be sung 'To its own proper tune; I will away, and I will not stay, &c'.
'The Gallant Grahames' celebrates the role of the Graham family in defending the Stewart succession in Britain during the seventeenth century. The hero of the poem is James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose, who fought for Charles I's forces against the English Cromwellian and Scottish Covenanting armies, and who was executed in 1650. After the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Montrose's corpse was exhumed and he was given a state funeral. The ballad can be dated to after these events.

14931,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(25a),"This song's first verse runs: 'It's noo I am a sodger, and they ca' me Willie Brown, / I used to be a weaver lad, and lived in Maxweltown, / But noo I am enlisted, and to Perth I going awa' / To join that gallant regiment that's cau'd the gallant forty-twa.' It was published by the Poet's Box in Dundee. At the bottom of the sheet is a list of other songs published by them.
The 'forty-twa' is the 42nd Highland Regiment, more commonly known as the Black Watch. It was established in 'to be constant guard for securing the peace in the Highlands' and 'to watch upon the braes'. The name comes from the dark tartans it's members wear, which was originally to distinguish them from regular troops who wore red uniforms. The narrator here has left Dundee to join them.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

As political broadsides often assumed a certain degree of knowledge amongst the readership, the subject matter can at times appear impenetrable to today's reader. The context of this highly-politicised ballad, however, is made clear by references to the corn laws, slavery, the church and free trade. The National Library of Scotland's collection includes many political ballads, a large number of which date from the nineteenth century - a time many claim was infected by 'reform fever'.

Although there is no music included on this sheet, the tune is named. It would have been well-known by its name, no doubt, amongst a large population of illiterate people who lived in the oral tradition. Two illustrative woodcuts have been included along the top of the sheet to improve the attraction of the piece. These woodcuts were expensive to produce and so were often of a generic topic so they could be reused.

' A note below the title states that this ballad was 'Written and sung by Mr J. Macguire, with the greatest succese', and that 'This popular song can be had at 190 and 192 Overgate, Dundee'. The note further states that the ballad was sung to the air, 'English, Welsh and Scotch'.
This somewhat saturnine ballad ponders the nature of friendship, and arrives at some rather gloomy conclusions on the subject. The writer invents some dark episodes that show the concept of friendship at its most mercenary. Despite this, however, the writer concludes on a positive note, by stating that there are still some good people in the world, and that folk should have faith in a person until that individual behaves in a manner that betrays their confidence. A peculiar ballad, it could be argued that this song is a good illustration of Scottish 'canniness', and the accompanying attitude of not confiding your business in a stranger.

The 'Learmonth' referred to in this text probably refers to John Learmonth, who was Lord Provost of Edinburgh in 1831. His most famous legacy is the Dean Bridge, which was built by Thomas Telford (1757-1834) in the same year. This bridge, a masterpiece in its own right, directly linked the roads to and from South Queensferry and the town. It was privately paid for by Learmonth, which improved the communication and transport route through his estate and enabled him to feu land for housing.
This style of text, with its implicit political propaganda, would not only have made for compelling entertainment, but would also perhaps have stimulated political thought, reasoning and debate.",Broadside ballad entitled 'Freedom and Learmonth Must Carry the Day',1830-1840

This song is referring to John Learmonth who was the owner of the Dean Estate, and Lord Provost of Edinburgh in the early 1830s. He is perhaps best remembered for funding the construction of the Dean Bridge, which was built by Thomas Telford in 1831. Here, he is being hailed as an acceptable alternative to the corrupt power of 'an impudent Lawyer, with wig and with gown'.

The first line of the ballad reads, 'DEAR John, what ails ye now? ly still'.
This light-hearted ballad was written in response to an audacious ballad penned by John Couper of Oxford, in which he lambasted Scottish culture in general, and the bagpipes in particular. It appears that once Couper arrived in Oxford, he started writing about the inferior quality of Scottish poetry in comparison to English poetry. In this erudite reply, however, Pate Birnie, a famous Scottish musician, waspishly suggests that English writers such as Dryden, Stanhope and Rosecommon are little more than Grub Street hacks. Located in Milton Street, Moorfields, London, Grub Street was infamous as a place where shabby writers mixed with impoverished booksellers' hacks.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day.

Employing the natural imagery that Burns himself used in his Romantic poems, this threnody is dedicated to the immortal memory of Scotland?s national bard, who died in 1796. In effect, this ballad is a literary form of the 'immortal memory', as proclaimed on the 25th of January by Burns' societies the world over. A festival in the poet's honour was held at Alloway in 1844, and the ballad might well have been written specially to celebrate this event. Many broadside ballads dedicated to the memory of Robert Burns are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

Burns wrote this version of 'Green Grow the Rashes, O' from a much older and more crude fragmentary ballad. This version is, however, considered to be imbued with tenderness and sentimentality. The message of the poem is that men who are driven by money and status may not be enjoying their lives to full. Instead, living on impulse and for the moment is the best way, especially in Calvinist Scotland. The poem ends with the sentiment that the most carefree time is spent among the lasses - a theme which was to characterise most of Burns's life.

The sheet was published by Muir, Gowans, & Co, and cost sixpence.
This address, written in the style of a ballad, is dedicated to the citizens of Glasgow. Given the frequent references to freedom and the end of tyranny, it could be that this ballad was written to commemorate the effects of the Great Reform Act of 1832. Unfortunately, however, the writer does not mention why this gathering of citizens has occurred, which means that modern-day readers have to jigsaw together events of the time to try and arrive at a logical conclusion. Likewise, without an explanation regarding who Charles St. Clair Johnstone was, again, it is not possible to place this broadside in its proper historical context. As broadsides were ephemeral publications, the audience would not have required any detailed explanation of these events.

This is a ballad mourning the death of Daniel O' Connell, the nineteenth century Irish home-rule campaigner who died in 1847 on a pilgrimage to Rome. He had suffered ill-health after being  imprisoned by the British government on alleged conspiracy charges. In this ballad he is resurrected as an Irish hero, fit to be in the company of those great heroes of Irish mythology. 'Granua' was the daughter of the Irish mythic hero Finn McCool, but in this context Grauna's voice represents the folk voice of the Irish people as a whole, and 'Granuale' is used as an alternative, ancient name for Ireland.

The sheet was published by Caldwell, a family firm which operated out of Paisley from the late eighteenth to late nineteenth century. A woodcut, seemingly unrelated to the ballad, adorns the top of the sheet.
It is likely that this broadside was published around 1840, about the time when Queen Victoria (r. 1837-1901) married her German cousin, Prince Albert, a member of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha family. This broadside suggests that among some ordinary people, who were suffering as a result of the Corn Laws and a general downturn in the economy, the pomp and ceremony of her wedding to this 'foreigner' caused outrage.

The chorus begins: 'A gossiping wife goes gadding about, / She's ever giving to roam'. It was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow, and probably sold for one penny.
This song, albeit in a light-hearted way, manages to reduce women to predictable stereotypes and, as result, portrays them in a rather negative light. Asked to choose between a 'A gossiping wife, or a passionate wife', the author makes no hesistation in his choice of a passionate wife. The 'gossiping wife' is considered a nuisance who will mind everyone's business but her own!

This song was published by the Poet's Box, Dundee.
This song appears to be a pastiche of advertisements taken out by general stores to advertise their wares. The song is more sophisticated in form than the majority of songs contained in broadsides. The opening verse, quoted above, does not have a simple end-rhyme scheme but contains lots of internal rhymes, and sentences whose conventional structure has been subverted. The song also contains spoken interludes, and verses are divided into 'departments', as in a shop. It was clearly a song for public performance, perhaps in a music hall.

This amusing and fast-paced ditty recounts the story of a wealthy girl's decision to take her marriage arrangements into her own hands. She was to be married to a squire but chose instead a farmer. She then 'arranged' a test which allowed the farmer to claim her as his own - very sneaky. No doubt this flight of fantasy would have kept an audience amused and many of the themes - class, marriage, shooting - would have been easily recognisable.

Gypsies are reputedly descended from the Romani, a nomadic people with origins in the Persian Gulf. According to gypsy law, the true gypsy King or  Queen is part of a blood lineage and is the leader of all the combined gypsy nations, but gypsy communities in separate countries and areas may also elect their own King or leader. Literature reveals a paradoxical attitude to gypsy culture in Great Britain. In some books, poems and songs, gypsies are regarded suspiciously and subjected to racial prejudice. However, in many other cases, the gypsy is celebrated as a romantic symbol of freedom, as in this ballad.

Very little is known about the figure 'Gilderoy', although he eventually became a literary motif for brave rascals. An incident was recorded on a broadside where a Perthshire highwayman, Patrick MacGregour, was hung in 1638. This information would fit the context of the lyrics but it is not absolutely certain. The lyrics blame 'English Laws' for the death of Gilderoy. This is a reference to the 'bloody code' instituted in England and adopted in Scotland, which were established specifically to protect property and possessions.

The ballad was to be sung to the tune 'Miller of Drone'. The broadside carries no publication details.
This ballad is not a real paraphrase of a condemned man's last speech. Rather, it is the work of a Radical poet, imagining the last words of a Scottish nobleman, Sir George Clerk of Penicuik (1787-1867), before he takes his own life. Clerk did not commit suicide, but the idea for the poem probably came from the suicide of Lord Castlereagh, Tory government civil spokesman, who cut his own throat in 1822 after being partially blamed for the Peterloo Massacre in 1819 and the introduction of the repressive, anti-Radical 'Six Acts'. Clerk of Penicuik also had Tory sympathies, and the author of this broadside obviously wishes as horrific a fate upon him as that which befell Castlereagh.
Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville (1742-1811) is named in this poem as the late 'beloved friend' of Clerk. To Radicals and reformers, especially in Scotland, Dundas epitomised all that was unjust about the political system. Voted Member of Parliament for Edinburgh by an electorate that represented a fraction of the population, Dundas generally protected landed interests and the status quo, and held such huge political influence that he was nicknamed the 'Uncrowned King of Scotland'.",Broadside entitled 'George's Clerk's Last Speech and Dying Words',1825-1840
16472,ballad,RB.m.143(182),"This political ballad begins: 'THE Whigs are vap'ring through the toun, / Wi' Campbell, counsel of the croun - / As is a lunnun lawyer loon, / Could ere compete wi' Aytoun!' A note below the title states that this is a new song, and should be sung to the tune, 'The auld wife ayont the fire'. While there are no publication details included on this sheet, the reference to Jamie Aytoun suggests that it was almost certainly published in Edinburgh during the 1830s.
Probably written from a supporter of the Radical Party, this 'Age of Party' ballad refers to an electoral contest that took place in Edinburgh during the 1830s. In this contest, the advocate, Jemmy - or Jamie - Aytoun (1797-1881), stood against the London-based lawyer, Sir John Campbell, who represented the Whig Party. Another rival candidate referred to in the ballad is John Learmonth, who was Lord Provost of Edinburgh in 1832. The National Library of Scotland's collection contains numerous broadsides that report on political contests in Edinburgh during this period, many of which champion the cause of Jamie Aytoun.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

It was advertised as a new song and was to be sung to the tune, 'The auld wife ayont the fire'. A woodcut illustration of a rather dubious-looking character adorns the top of the sheet.
The 'Honest Aytoun' of the title is most likely James Aytoun (1797-1881), a prominent Radical who stood for election as member of parliament for Edinburgh in the mid-nineteenth century. 'Campbell', who is described here as 'a Lunnon lawyer loon', was the London-based lawyer, Sir John Campbell, who stood as the Whig candidate in the same election. In the final verse reference is also made to the Tory candidate, John Learmonth. A large number of broadsides were printed regarding these elections and the characters involved, many of which can now be found in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

As can be surmised from the surname, Barlycorn, this light-hearted ballad celebrates the manner in which alcohol oils the wheels of society. The character of Sir John Barlycorn is a personification of alcohol, and the ballad uses this symbol to show the heated response to the passing of the Malt Tax in 1725. Prime Minister Robert Walpole (1676-1745) imposed this hefty duty tax on Scottish ale, and this led to a number of riots. Such was the violence of one riot in Shawfield that the whole city of Glasgow had to pay a fine! Amusingly, the ballad-writer likens the effect of the tax to a drought, and imagines what a Scotland without alcohol would be like.

There are no publication details given, but this is one of two songs - printed by James Lindsay - on this sheet. 
This ballad tells the story of a young Irishman who enlists in the army following an argument with his sweetheart. He soons finds himself being transported overseas to fight against the Russians in the Crimean War (1854-6). The conditions on board the boat are primitive and, upon landing, the 'hungry army' is ordered to 'make a brave stand'. Wounded at the Battle of Inkerman and treated in hosiptal, the young man ends up with a 'wood peg' for a leg.
Interestingly, it was only a few days after the Battle of Inkerman that Florence Nightingale arrived in Turkey, to tend to the wounded. Perhaps best remembered for her work during the Crimean War, in the military hospitals of Turkey, Florence Nightingale, along with a team of nurses, succeeded in vastly improving conditions whilst there and, as a direct result, dramatically reduced the mortality rate.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The Hungry Army',1852-1859

The narrator of this ballad is an Irish foreman who has come to Glasgow to oversee the production of asphalt for road building. During the industrialisation of Scotland new and improved roads had to be built quickly, and Irish immigrants, who worked in many areas of Scottish industry, became particularly stereotyped as road and rail builders. 'Hot Ashfelt!' picks up on this stereotype, with the narrator describing the prejudice he has encountered from the Scottish police. The song ends in victory for the narrator, who entombs the policeman in hot asphalt, but it probably did little to dispell anti-Irish stereotypes.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information  such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day. Cheaply available, they were sold on the streets by pedlars and chapmen.

'Taw' is a game of marbles and 'pelf' means 'riches' or 'booty'. The publisher of the broadside was the Poet's Box, (probably Glasgow) but the town of publication has been obscured. The sheet was published on Saturday, 28th January 1871, and was priced at one penny.
'A Horse Chestnut and a Chestnut Horse' is a comic ballad satirising the philosophy of logic, and also, to an extent, satirising the English public school system. The author's point is that while the arguments of logic assume language to be fixed and rigid in meaning, in reality the same words can take on different meanings or implications according to the context they are placed in. He suggests this by making the Uncle in the ballad 'prove' to his cocky, Eton-educated nephew, that according to the arguments of logic, a horse chestnut and a chestnut horse are the same thing.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

A generic woodcut has been included to add to the market appeal of the sheet. This broadside ballad should be sung to the tune of 'Hail great Sir, &c'. It was probably printed by John Reid in Edinburgh.
Many of these broadside ballads stem from a purely oral tradition and even when recorded at the time, were treated as ephemera. As a result not much information is available on either the lyrics or the melody, although they were probably well-known at the time. The use of the name Sylvia here, however, does reflect the growth in classical interest during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Always a popular Italian name and having direct Roman origins, it was used as a literary motif to convey sophisticated Italian connotations.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.","Broadside ballad entitled 'Hope Farewel, Adieu to all Pleasure, or Silvia's Matchless Cruelty'",1701
15975,ballad,L.C.1268,"This ballad (sung to the air, 'The King of the Cannibal Islands') begins: 'The Whigs are vapouring thro' the town, / That Frank, the Barber's coming down, / (The doited, petted, gabby loon) / To put out Jemmy Ayton.' It is decorated with a woodcut illustration, which incorporates the motto 'ENGLAND EXPECTS EVERY MAN TO DO HIS DUTY' - famously signalled by Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar.
A note at the bottom of the broadside informs the reader that 'Frank, the Barber' refers to Francis Jeffrey (1773-1850), who is probably best remembered as founder of the magazine, the 'Edinburgh Review'. A staunch Whig, Jeffrey was appointed Lord Advocate in 1830, became an MP for Edinburgh in 1832 and was created a law lord in 1834. This song is partly a reaction to his decision to enter politics. James Ayton or Aytoun (1797-1881) was prominent in Edinburgh politics in the 1830s.
This broadside, along with many others, assumes a certain degree of knowledge amongst the readership of the day. Those mentioned within the verses were obviously familiar characters and the context was well known. As a result, at first glance, the subject matter can often appear a little obscure to a twenty-first century audience.","Broadside ballad entitled 'Honest Jemmy Ayton, A New Reform Song'",1832

The Whig political party had touted an increase in the voting base if they came to power and, in 1830, they took over the reins of the British government. In 1831 the Reform Bill was rejected but eventually became law when tendered again in 1832. This led to a mild increase in the numbers of those who qualified to vote. During the rest of the 1830s further bills were passed on electoral reform and town council rights. 'Jemmy Ayton' may be one and the same as James Aytoun (1797-1831), advocate and manufacturer.

No publication details are given.
The piece was composed on the occasion of the restoration to favour of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll (1680-1743). Campbell was a Scottish general, and was a strong supporter of the 1707 Act of Union between England and Scotland. He served in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14) and rose to be commander-in-chief in Spain in 1711. On his return to Scotland, heralded by this broadside, he actively supported the succession of George I (r. 1714-27). Campbell also commanded the army that put down the 1715 Jacobite rebellion.

This romantic ballad tells of the love between a maiden called Mary and a Highland soldier. Despite the warnings from her beloved concerning the many dangers that exist in marrying a soldier, Mary declares that her love is all conquering. Overwhelmed by her offer of true love, the soldier agrees to marry her. It is interesting that the maiden in this ballad is an active - rather than passive - character, and proposes to the soldier rather than vice-versa. Many romantic broadside ballads such as this one are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets.

A note below the title states that this ballad is 'A NEW REFORM SONG', and should be sung to the air, 'The King of the Cannibal Islands'. Unfortunately, no publication details are included on the broadside. However, the reference to Francis Jeffrey (founder and editor of 'the Edinburgh Review') at the foot of the sheet, suggests that it was most likely published in the 1820s or 1830s.
This political broadside contains an attack on the Lord Advocate, Francis Jeffrey (1773-1850), who stood - as a Whig - for election to become MP for Edinburgh in 1832. Instead, the writer wants electors to vote for Jemmy (James) Ayton (1797-1881), whom he believes to be more honest than the other candidates. Francis Jeffrey was editor of 'The Edinburgh Review', so the writer makes great play of advising 'Frank' to stick to his day job of writing reviews. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be any information regarding who Jemmy Ayton was, thus highlighting the ephemeral nature of many broadsides. As Jeffrey was successful in his efforts to get elected, Jemmy Ayton probably suffered the curse of historical anonymity that often befalls losing candidates.

The pitting of true love against social obligations or expectations was a common theme in ballads from the earliest times. In this ballad a young nobleman's daughter is expected to marry a squire of her own class, although she is secretly in love with a farmer from a lower social order. True love conquers here, mainly due to the girl's cunning in giving the farmer the golden glove that will determine who she is to marry. Such a manipulation of fate is an unusual twist to a familiar ballad topic.

'Highland Mary', or Mary Campbell, was one of Robert Burns's (1759-96) great loves, and he wrote this poem for her in 1792. The introduction to the poem, written, presumably, by the broadside publisher, is of interest because it puts it in context. It tells the tragic tale of how Burns and Mary were cruelly parted by her untimely death from typhus in 1786.

This ballad is narrated by the Highland minstrel boy of the title, and is a tribute to a girl called Mary. In the final verse it becomes apparent that the narrator is recently widowed, and he is remembering his late wife as she was when he first knew her many years before. The Highlander became a conventional romantic figure in many areas of the arts in the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries after the publication of James Macpherson's 'Ossian' poems and Sir Walter Scott's 'Waverley' novels. This song made its way to Australia where it became 'Her Ireland minstrel boy'. It is better known under the titles of 'Banks o' Clyde' or 'Bonnie Moon'.

This ballad contains transcriptions of Highland pronounciation and phraseology such as 'her nane sels', meaning 'his', 'Sh' substituted for a soft 'G', and 'T' substituted for initial 'D', as in 'Shentleman' and 'Tonald'. Such renderings of Highland English would later become more familiar to the general public through the bestselling novels of Sir Walter Scott. The story in this ballad is also the sort that inspired Scott, featuring a clansman vowing revenge against the enemies of his dead companion.

The music for this ballad was arranged by Thomas Augustine Arne (1710-1778), composer of 'Rule Britannia', who arranged other ballads in the National Library of Scotland's collection. This dates the ballad to some time in the mid-eighteenth century. The fact that the song was performed at the prestigious Theatre Royal in Drury Lane reflects a burgeoning English interest in Scottish Highland culture that was to increase dramtically with the success of Sir Walter Scott's 'Waverley' novels after 1814.

This ballad is narrated by a traveller who is pledging love to his sweetheart at home, regardless of what might befall him on his voyages. In the sixth of eight verses, the tone of the poem changes briefly, as the narrator expresses his fear that his sweetheart might fall out of love with him, before trying to dismiss such thoughts in verse seven. This recalls renaissance 'courtly love' poetry, where extravagant tributes to the object of desire were often alternated with professions of unworthiness from the narrator.

Illustrated with a woodcut of three cronies drinking a toast, this 'Age of Party' political pamphlet is dedicated to the principles of James Aytoun (1797-1881). During the 1830s, Aytoun was a member of the Radical Party who unsuccessfully stood for election in Edinburgh. The writer criticises the Whigs and Tories for being corrupt, and proclaims that 'honest Aytoun' is the solution to the electorate's woes.

The tune 'Carle an' the King Came' was made famous by Robert Burns, who published it in his folksong collection entitled 'Scots Musical Museum'. The tune itself, however, was much older but had no history attached to it as it was very much embedded in the oral tradition. There are at least two Aytouns who might be the character mentioned here. William Edmonstoune Aytoun (1813-65), the Scottish poet who eventually worked for the University of Edinburgh, was renowned for his Tory views and especially for his support of the party during the Anti-Corn-Law struggle. Another possibility is that it refers to the Radical politician, James Aytoun, (1797-1881) who was active in Edinburgh at this time.
This style of text, with its implicit political propaganda, would not only have made for compelling entertainment, but would also perhaps have stimulated political thought, reasoning and debate.",Broadside ballad entitled 'Here's a Health to Aytoun!',1830-1840

This sheet was published by the Poet's Box of the Overgate, Dundee.
The Poet's Box of Dundee published many broadside ballads such as this, as can be seen from the list at the bottom of this sheet. Dundee locals could buy copies from street pedlars or by calling into the Poet's Box. For those living further afield, the company would also sent sheets by post, in return for stamps, which they would presumably use in their everyday business, and stamps covering the cost of postage.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson. 
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

16436,ballad,RB.m.143(144),"This ballad begins: 'The harp that once through Tara's hall / The sound of music shed, / Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls, / As if that soul were fled.' It was published in 1875, by the Poet's Box of 80 London Street, Glasgow. The address has been partially obscured - possibly the publisher went into liquidation or moved premises.
Although he is not credited here, this ballad was written by the Irish barrister and poet, Thomas Moore (1779-1852). Tara is the mysterious hilltop site in Co. Meath that was once home to the Irish high kings. The piece was written while Ireland was under English rule, and Moore's Tara symbolises the seat of Irish government and the rule of Ireland. The harp, Ireland's traditional instrument, symbolises Irish culture and spirit.

The sheet carries no publication details.
'The Harper o' Mull' was written by Robert Tannahill (1774-1810), a Paisley weaver and accomplished songwriter. Unlike most of Tannahill's work, which was inspired by the Renfrewshire countryside, the Harper o' Mull was based on a Highland tale that Tannahill had read. The story concerns a Mull man who burns his beloved harp to give warmth to his young wife, who has fallen ill on a journey. The wife recovers but runs away with another man, leaving the Harper of Mull to rue his hasty actions.

This ballad is a tribute to Robert Burns (1759-96). It tells a fantastical story of a young girl walking by the 'banks and braes o' bonnie Doon' (one of a number of references to Burns's poems throughout the piece), who gives the bard her harp so that he may better compose tunes to fit his lyrics.

This sheet was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow (1852-59). There is a woodcut illustration of a well-dressed, country girl balancing two baskets included at the top.
Gentle Annie was written by Stephen Foster (1826-64), in 1856, and was inspired by his grandmother, Annie Pratt McGinnis Hart. This is now considered to be one of Foster's six finest songs. Born in Lawerenceville, Pennsylvania, his politically and financially successful large family objected to his interest in music. Once his fame had spread, however, and the money began rolling in, his family were won over!
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.",Broadside ballad entitled 'Gentle Annie',1852-1859
16319,ballad,RB.m.143(007),"This ballad begins: 'Before Apollo had a lute / More than a hundred year, / Macgregor played on his own pipes / His Highland clan to cheer.' A note below the title states that 'This Popular Reading can always be had at the Poet's Box'. Unfortunately, it is not specified which particular Poet's Box in Scotland published this sheet and also no date of publication has been included. The list of other songs that are available for purchase from the Poet's Box makes for interesting reading, and reveals much about the type of content that was often included in broadsides.
Written in a lofty and erudite manner, this light-hearted ballad celebrates the achievements of the MacGregor Clan. By comparing some legendary MacGregors to famous characters from literature such as Apollo, Ajax, Achilles and Samson, the writer draws attention to the musical and martial qualities possessed by members of the clan. Indeed, the ballad reads much like a eulogy. Interestingly, the writer also incorporates the Ossian stories into his tribute, and weaves together biblical tales, Celtic myths and classical myths into the one, overall pattern. The outlaw, Rob Roy MacGregor (1671-1734), was probably the most famous member of the MacGregor clan, and a famous statue of him can be found in Stirling.

The authorship of the poem is credited to 'one of themselves', 'themselves' being a reference to the 'Deliverers' of the title. The sheet carries no publication details.
A 'hansel' or 'handsel' is a gift given to celebrate the start of something new. It can also refer to the first instalment of a payment. In Scotland, the first Monday after New Year's Day was traditionally known as 'Hansel Monday' or 'Handsel Monday', and gifts were given at this time. The poem shown on this broadside was one apparently written by one of the Midlothian Advertiser's paper-boys, and was presumably delivered, along with the newspaper, on Hansel Monday.

The ballad was to be sung 'To its own Proper Tune'.
In a short introduction, this ballad is described as 'Giving an account of their Original, and of Rodger Earl of Montgomerie, Salsberry and Arundale, General to William the Conqueror his coming to England, with several parts of History concerning them, ending with an Advice to the Chief of the CLAN.' The poem describes how Philip Montgomerie, having seen his English lands forfeited, came to Scotland and was awarded land by the King of Scotland, thus establishing the Montgomerie family north of the border.

A note under the title informs the readers that the ballad was 'Sung with immense success by TOM BOWLING'.
At the bottom of this particular broadside an advertisement listing a number of other songs to be had at the Poet's Box is included. Broadsides featuring songs and ballads were always extremely popular with the public. Usually bought for one penny, the song could be memorised and passed on to countless others. Although the literacy rate at this time was extremely low, songs could easily be memorised upon hearing.

It was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow, and includes a woodcut illustration of a carefree young man throwing a stick for a dog.
The free and easy lad of this song appears to be very philosophical, living his life according to a very simple yet profound belief: 'I care for all, yet care for no man, / Those who mean well should not fear, / I like a man and love a woman, / What else makes this life so dear'.

This ballad was published at 190 Overgate, Dundee, probably by the Poet's Box. Under the title it is printed, 'Sung with great Success throught all the princpal Concerts in the City by J. OATES'
Romantic ballads that prized true love above wealth were quite common in Scotland. 'Fourteen Bob' is a satirical twist on that theme. It is narrated by a woman who plans to marry her Johnnie against her mother's advice and despite the fact he only earns 'fourteen bob'. The final four lines undercut the apparently noble message of the balld by exposing Johnnie's chavinism and the narrator's naivety: 'But Johnnie says what ere we get / Well get it nice and clean, / Its he'll get all the beef tae chew / And ah can lick the banes.'

The first line of the song reads: 'I'll seek a four-leaved shamrock'. The sheet was published by the Poet's Box of Glasgow.
It is not clear who Shields is, but this piece was in fact written by the Irish songwriter, painter and novelist, Samuel Lover (1797-1868). The proprietor of the Glasgow Poet's Box, Matthew Leitch, was well-known for his flamboyant sales techniques, which often led to slight embellishments of the truth! With no copyright law in place at this time, publishers were free to reproduce existing works without fear of prosecution.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?!

The song was written by James Currns (probably James Curran, a Glasgow song-writer and parodist), and published by the Poet's Box of Dundee. It was sold for a penny.
Football was rapidly increasing in popularity at the time of this broadside's publication. The 1850 Factory Act was instrumental in this because it established the right for time off for industrial workers and Saturday quickly became recognised as free time. Also, a cheaper and more efficient rail network made travelling to and from games much easier, and leagues were formed as a result. The Scottish Football Association was established in 1872.

Currency was and indeed still is the property of the Crown in the United Kingdom, therefore forgery or the defacing of currency is an offence against the Crown. It was normal for moral lessons to be conveyed through fictitious, shock stories.

The publication details are printed on this broadside, but a later hand has obscured them.
'Forty Years Ago' is a simple ballad lamenting the lost youth of an old man. The narrative begins in the third person, but in the last verse it switches to the first person and we realise that the narrator has been speaking of himself all along. This is quite a common technique in poetry and fiction. It makes the work suddenly more personal, and should elict greater sympathy for, and empathy with, the narrator.

Priced at one penny, this broadside could be purchased from the Poet's Box, Glasgow. It is dated 'Saturday, July 11, 1874'.
Also known as 'Man on the Flying Trapeze', this light-hearted song is a young man's lament over the betrayal of his sweetheart as she disappears into the arms of a trapeze artist. Captivated by his physique and expertise on the trapeze, 'His movements were graceful, all girls he could please', the young woman elopes with him one night. The song ends with the young man spying 'A bill in red letters, which did my heart gall, / That she was appearing with him.' It has been suggested that this song was written about the trapeze artist, Jules Leotard, who in the 1860s performed in London wearing the costume that now bears his name.

Flora MacDonald, born on South Uist in 1722, is now the most famous heroine of the Jacobite cause and one of its most romantic stories. Bonnie Prince Charlie was fleeing Scotland after his Culloden defeat. When the situation became perilous on the Isle of Skye, Flora was persuaded to participate in her foster-father, Clanranald's, plan to help Charles' escape. After this she was tracked and was imprisoned by the Hanoverians and she spent a year in the tower of London. She was eventually released in 1747 and died in 1790.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day.

This song was published at 192 Overgate, Dundee, probably by the Poet's Box.
The practice of performing songs for public entertainment predated printing, and knowledge of many ballads was passed on from performer to performer or handed down though families. Inevitably different versions of one story would evolve, and even when ballads began to be collected and printed several differing sets of words might be found accompanying the same tune or title. 'Flora the Lily of the West' is one such ballad. This appears to be an English lyric, but versions set in Ireland and America are also extant.

15057,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(94c),"Verse 1: 'I'm a factory gal as you may see, / You'd like to know perhaps who I be; / If you will listen to my rhyme, / I'll tell you now all in good time. / My mother lives down pot alley, / The boys all call me charming Sally; / Be their delight I always shall, / While I'm a flare-up factory gal.'
The cheerful tone of the narrator of this ballad is at odds with our modern perceptions of the society she describes. The 'factory girl' is just that - a child labourer rather than a young woman. The employment of children in factories was an integral part of Britain's dramatic industrial expansion in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as they were a cheap, easily-managed workforce. Despite some strong opposition to child labour, until 1891 children as young as nine could be working almost sixty hours per week, often in unsafe and unhealthy conditions.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

'Wae' is Scots for 'woeful', 'scanty' means 'meagre' and 'whiles' means 'sometimes'.
This well-composed ballad contains many elements which mark it out as typical of the broadside folk song. Firstly, its focus is very much on hardship and poverty in a rural setting. The narrator, the oldest of five children, realises that he must go out to work if the family is to survive. A second theme, very popular in these ballads, is the boy's love for his mother. The final subject, typical at a time when many Scots were leaving for pastures new, is emigration.

This ballad is unusual because it contains not only standard verses, which are to be sung to the tune of 'Oor Jock's a handy chappie', but it also includes large portions of narrative which are to be spoken.  It demands a participatory audience, and it is easy to imagine the narrator getting quite animated reciting the text, and a crowd of listeners joining in for the chorus.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s.

Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.

This ballad tells the story of the fisherman, Dunkey, and his brother, the sailor, who returns from distant shores with a monkey. Neglecting to warn his brother of the monkey's existence, the young sailor travels to Glasgow to visit a sweetheart, leaving the monkey behind in Dunkey's house. The ballad ends with Dunkey and some fellow fisherman hanging the poor monkey. Although humorous in tone, this ballad ends on a rather grisly note - only adding to its appeal amongst audiences! Upon its publication, strains of this ballad would probably have been heard issuing forth from the alehouses and taverns of Greenock and its environs.

There are many ballads held in the National Library of Scotland's collection which are on the topic of sailors, the sea and their families. This must have been a popular theme amongst many of Scotland's citizens, given the country's reliance on fishing, trade and the military for vocations. Although this poem is quite long, in itself an attractive marketing ploy, it is relatively unusual for a poem, with such a generic context, to be unaccompanied by a woodcut.

15046,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(89b),"This ballad begins: 'We sailed from the Downs in a ship called the Lion, / With fifty brass guns our crew could rely on; / Larboard and starboard we had a bold crew / Which no equal number of foes could subgue.' It was priced one penny and published by the Poet's Box, 190 and 192 Overgate, Dundee.
This comic ballad, narrated by a sailor on a ship 'bound for the west', betrays some of the prejudices of its time. Among the crew are two men from minority groups, a Quaker, and an Irishman. Both are figures of ridicule. The Quaker, one of a conservative protestant sect founded in 1647, is mocked for his pious unwillingness to join battle with the French but is redeemed when his life is imperilled and he instinctively begins to fight. The Irishman is satirised more savagely and portrayed as cowardly and stupid. Anti-Irish polemic was common in Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

The text preceding it reads: 'A song for the fleet called Jack and the Bear-skin / AIR - ""The deeds of Napoleon"".'
The purpose of this song may have been two-fold. Firstly, to reassure members of the audience who were living apart from loved ones that those absent were safe and having a good time. Secondly, to glamorise and immortalise the act of leaving loved ones and travelling for those in the audience who fitted this work pattern. Although this is mere speculation, the narrative is a good entertaining story which moves at a varied and fast pace to keep the audience entertained.

Below the title we are told that 'Copies can always be had at the Poets Box, 190 Overgate, Dundee'. 'Ava' means 'at all'.
This ballad is an interesting piece of social history, for the way in which it supports a railway strike that took place during the early days of the railways. It is likely that the phrase, 'It's No' The Clean Tattie Ava', is a colloquial expression meaning 'something is not fair at all'. Given that this railway strike probably took place some time in the 1840s, the obscure expression might well be an anti-establishment reference to the potato famines that caused so much suffering in Ireland and Scotland. Certainly, the ballad sounds like a trade union song, although the peculiar last verse appears rather incongruous.

The second ballad begins: 'Come all you sons of Erin, / Who love your native soil ; / I claim your kind attention, / Just for a little while.'
Although these songs appear to be unrelated they are in fact both about Ireland and the exploits of Irishmen. The first ballad, also known by the titles 'The shamrock green' and 'The convict's song', refers to the penal colony established on the island of Mauritius.

Illustrated with a woodcut of a castle flying the Lion Rampant flag, this patriotic ballad makes an emotional appeal for Scottish Home Rule. The author tries to win the audience's sympathy, by lining up an impressive pageant of heroes from Scotland's glorious past. Thus, the martial glories of Robert the Bruce (1274-1329) and William Wallace (c. 1274-1305) are contrasted with the machinations of Westminster politicians such as Sir William Gladstone (1809-98) and Viscount John Morley (1823-96).

This ballad deals with the popular broadside theme of the pain of love and the misbehaviour of lovers. There is also an odd reference at the end where the reader is supposed to wish themselves to the green pastures of Manchester. Lindsay published many broadsides on an Irish theme, suggesting that one of his authors, or even he himself, had Irish connections.

Many of the Irish emigrants who gained access to America settled in the area around New York, and it was here that the Irish Brigade was raised at the onset of civil war.

Probably written some time between 1830 and 1860, this broadside ballad is a vitriolic attack on all politicians, regardless of party. As the names of the politicians are blanked out by the anonymous writer, the ballad resembles a masque - indeed, the style, tone and subject matter of the ballad is similar to 'The Masque of Anarchy', by P.B. Shelley. The ballad cuts its way through this procession of politicians, highlighting their many flaws and comparing them to chimpanzees and baboons.

Through their understanding and appreciation of the more impressive aspects of classical civilisation, Antiquarians played an integral part in the formation of the Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth century.

This ballad, in common with many published in the eighteenth century, focuses on the morality of affairs outside wedlock. Typically in these ballads, men are portrayed as being in thrall to their impulses: women are expected to take responsibilty for ensuring that the accepted boundaries of propriety are not crossed, and are condemned if they are. Today the contents of this ballad, where a male narrator claims he has talked an initially reluctant partner into 'kind non-resistance', would be regarded as questionable.

Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson. 
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites. The term 'ballad' eventually applied more broadly to any kind of topical or popular verse.","Broadside ballads entitled 'I'm off to Kindonald', 'It was not my Fortune to get her', 'Ilka Blade o' Grass Keps its ain Drap o' Dew', and 'It's a Fine Thing an Ingin'",1880-1900

' 'Muleteer' means 'mule-driver'. A note below the title states that 'Copies of this popular song can only be had in the Poet's Box', (probably Glasgow) and that the ballad should be sung to an original air. The sheet was printed on the Saturday morning of September 17th, 1864, and cost one penny.
This rambling ballad is written from the viewpoint of a muleteer - that is, a mule-driver. The verses tell of his mules, work, travels and attitude to life. The 'Clic clac' refrain that recurs throughout the ballad, meanwhile, is an onomatopoeic attempt to recreate the sound that he hears while riding his mule. Below the ballad, there is a notice informing readers about the various types of publishing services (complete with prices) that the Poet's Box can offer the public, plus a catalogue listing of other ballads that are available for purchase.

The sheet was printed by J. Bowie of Causeyside, Paisley.
A detailed, though not very well printed, woodcut adorns the top of this sheet. It illustrates the ballad's themes of virility and belligerence well. It features a well-dressed young man wearing a long sword around his waist and carrying a shorter sword in his right hand. Behind him is a low wall, against which rests a large anchor and a cannon. Beyond the wall lies the sea, and a large war ship and a lightouse are visible.
Woodcuts are the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate.

This sheet was priced at one penny and could be purchased from the Poet's Box. Although the address has been scored out, probably as a result of a change of premises, it did read 80 London Street, Glasgow.
The accompanying tune is referred to as the 'Original', suggesting that the people buying this particular broadside were already familiar with the song and tune. Most of the songs and ballads that were printed by broadside producers were well-known amongst the populace.

This song was published by the Poet's Box, of the Overgate, Dundee.
This is a song in praise of women, young and old. Although the singer 'loves the bonnie lassies' he also recognises that the 'poor old grannie' used to be one. The last verse illustrates the seniments well: 'Then here's to every mother, and every sister dear, / And while the sands of time run in the glass, / Let the toast of our lives be our sweethearts and our wives, / And success to every bonnie, bonnie lass.'

It was published by the Poet's Box, Dundee, and sold for a penny. An interesting woodcut of a stag standing beside an old tree adorns the top of the sheet. As with many broadsides, the woodcut appears to bear no direct relevance to the text. This was because woodcuts were reused, and broadsides were cheap and disposable - there was no point going to the trouble of making a new one for each piece. It is there simply for decoration.
This song concerns family and community ties, especially the feeling that there is a duty to look after the elderly as they had looked after their young. It is interesting to note that this song must have crossed the Atlantic. It is quoted in Louisa May Alcott's (1832-88) novel 'Jo's Boys' (1886).

The chorus reads: 'Flowers may bloom fair ayont the sea; / But oh! My Highland hame for me.' It was published by James Lindsay of 11 King Street, Glasgow, and includes a woodcut illustration of a highlander playing the bagpipes.
Although no date has been included on this broadside, it was most likely published between 1860 and 1894 - the years during which Lindsay had premises at 11 King Street. This ballad presents a romantic view of rural life that was extremely popular during the nineteenth century, and can be found in the literature of the day. It would have appealed to those who had moved from the Highlands to the overcrowded and polluted cities of the south. Although life in the Highlands was far from idyllic, existing in the often squalid conditions of the cities, understandably, led to people romanticising their past.

James King is believed to have worked from 11 King Street in Glasgow for thirty years - between 1860 and 1890. It was during this time that Highlanders were being forced to leave their homes in the north and either seek work in the cities or emigrate to a new life completely. Glasgow, with its fast industrial expansion, had the greatest appeal to those seeking new lives. Perhaps the topic of this song was aimed at this section of the market.

The four ballads here are printed on one broadside headed 'Harmonist'. Although it was not uncommon for more than one ballad to appear on a broadside, the separate title for the sheet suggests that this may be one of a series of broadside songsheets entitled 'Harmonist', that made several different songs available in every issue. There are, however, no publication details or issue numbers printed on the broadside to verify this.

The sheet was printed around 1719, by R. Thomas in London. It was also reprinted in Edinburgh.
This ballad was written after the 'little uprising' at Glenshiel in 1719, when an army of Jacobites under General Wightman and the 10th Earl Marischal were thwarted at Glenshiel by Hanoverian government forces. The ballad mocks the Jacobite army's claims that they escaped with no casualties, even though the battle raged for hours, and exalts the government forces for showing mercy.

Although no publication date is included, a note at the foot of the sheet states that it was published by Waugh of Edinburgh.
This political ballad refers to the contest between Sir James Spittal (1769-1842) and Jamie - or Jemmy - Aytoun(1797-1881), who were campaigning to be elected as Provost of Edinburgh. James Spittal was Provost from 1833-7 and was the first Provost elected by a free vote after the passing of the Burgh Reform Act in 1833. This sheet was probably published around 1833. The National Library of Scotland's collection contains a number of broadsides describing this electoral contest. One, from the same publisher as this, is named 'Huzza! for Provost Aytoun!!' - obviously publishers could make more money by appealing to both factions!

This broadside includes a woodcut illustration of a man and woman - both of whom appear to be merrily drunk - walking arm in arm.
Unlike the majority of political broadsides, the publisher of this piece has deemed it necessary to include a number of explanatory notes at the bottom of the page. Whilst the information was obviously intended for the readers of the day, it is particularly helpful to a modern-day audience. As political broadsides often assumed a certain degree of knowledge amongst the readership, the subject matter can at times appear impenetrable to today's reader.

Two woodcuts have been included on this sheet - one at the top of thistles and a bonnet and one at the bottom of a smiling clown's face.
The Whig party was created by those who wanted more democratic powers for the parliament. The Whig base was originally in the countryside but this soon changed as their progressive attitude began to appeal to those in the newer industrial areas. The main thrust of their reforming programme was the enfranchisement of larger numbers of society.

It was to be sung to the tune of 'Johnny Cope' and includes a woodcut illustration of a carriage pulled by a team of horses.
The 'Jemmie Forrest' of the title refers to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, James Forrest. The song revolves around a rather unfortunate incident that took place upon the arrival of Queen Victoria in Edinburgh, during her 1842 tour of Scotland. Although the Lord Provost and the Bailies of Edinburgh were meant to form a welcoming party to greet the sovereign, when Victoria arrived in the capital there was no one there to meet her. This was highly embarrassing for those involved and provided fuel for a great many humorous broadsides.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day. Cheaply available, they were sold on the streets by pedlars and chapmen.

Half of a woodcut illustration can be seen at the top of the sheet, although the top half of it has been ripped off at some point. It would probably have depicted a coach and pair.
Jemmie Forrest was the Lord Provost of Edinburgh in 1842, the year in which Queen Victoria completed her tour of her Scottish realm. Unfortunately for Jemmie there were one or two incidents which caused the city a little embarrassment during her stay. Stands had been set up in Edinburgh so that citizens could view the sovereign's procession. One of these collapsed - killing two people and injuring about 48 more. The Earl of Errol was run over by the Queen's carriage. There was also a security mix-up and the Queen's bodyguards and the city guards became involved in a brawl thus endangering everyone's lives.

The tune 'Johnny Cope' was a well-recognised and well-used Jacobite tune, which in turn had been well established in the oral tradition. Not only would its familiarity have appealed to readers but it kept the Jacobite memory alive. The song itself refers to a giant bungle. On her 1842 tour of Scotland, Queen Victoria was supposed to have been officially met and welcomed to the city of Edinburgh. The Lord Provost, James Forrest, however, missed her entrance and his entourage were mistaken for assassins, which placed both parties in real danger!

The note 'Music at JAS. S. KERR'S, 314 Paisley Rd., Glasgow' is included under the title.
Jeanie Deans was the heroine of Sir Walter's Scott's novel, 'The Heart of Midlothian' (1818). Her story is outlined in this song and Scott is given recognition for his part in her creation. The character of Jeanie Deans was loosely based on Helen Walker who did indeed walk to London to obtain a pardon for her sister who was imprisoned for murdering her child.

This ballad was to be sung to an 'Original' tune and was priced at one penny. It was published on Saturday, 28th October 1865 by the Poet's Box, probably in Glasgow.
One of the most interesting aspects of this ballad is the picture it paints of fashionable society in England in the nineteenth century. Almost all the locations mentioned, including Burlington Arcade, Brighton, Cremorne Gardens and Kensington, are places that became highly popular with the English moneyed classes in the Regency period (1810-1820). The fate of the beautiful embezzler Jemima Brown, running a grocer's shop with her children in Camden Town, seems quite modest in contrast to the description of her early dalliance with the narrator.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

This broadside was published and distributed by the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee. It includes songs that would have already been well known to the audience of the day, and as a result probably sold well. Whilst most broadsides featured one or at most two ballads, this sheet of four songs would have been considered good value for money. 
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs.

There is a woodcut depiction of a rather spruce looking soldier above the title.
This song is based on an old traditional Perthshire bothy song, which was especially popular amongst travellers. This version was inspired by the storming of Fort St Michael at Burgos, during the Peninsular War of 1811. At this time, Britain was fighting the French for control over various parts of Spain. Ironically, taking the King's shilling or joining up was an attractive offer at this time, as many of the Highland tenants were being cleared from their land to make way for sheep farming. The song went on to be rewritten again by Ewan McColl, and his version remains very popular. Jamie Foyers is thought to have been a generic Perthshire term for a soldier.

It was to be sung to the air, 'The Indulgent Landlord's March', and was dedicated to the Glasgow Political Union. The sheet was entitled 'Glasgow Melodies - No. 1.' and was printed by W. & W. Miller of the Trongate, Glasgow.
Although no publication date has been attached to this sheet, it is known that W. and W. Miller were working out of the Trongate in the 1830s. It is very likely, therefore, that this sheet was published around that time. They are also known to have had premises at 90 Bell Street between 1837 and 1840. Whilst the subject matter of this ballad might be a little unfamiliar to a modern-day audience, the broadside readership of the day would have been au fait with the politics of this piece.

This ballad addresses a common theme of broadsides - the differences between northern and southern Scots. Here they are highlighted as clothing, education and manners. The Highland lass, Jenny, however, is prettier than any southern girl and, it is suggested, has an open and innocent air about her. This broadside also has a happy ending, with neither partner regretting their choice, even after such a long time together.

This ballad was published at 192 Overgate, Dundee, probably by the Poet's Box. It was to be sung to an 'original' tune, and was priced one penny.
This is a version of a ballad whose authorship has often been credited to Robert Burns. In fact, the song credited to Burns started out as a poem to Wilhelmina Alexander (1753-1843) sister of the Laird of Ballochmyle. Burns's poem was later adapted into a song with the addition of the traditional chorus that also features in the song on this broadside. This is an example of how several different ballads based on the same story could evolve.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs.

16615,ballad,RB.m.168(248),"Verse 1 begins: 'AROUSE! arouse! Ilk kilted clan, / Let High'land hearts lead on the van'. It was published by T.Birt of 10 Great St Andrews Street, London. A woodcut of the crest of the Prince of Wales has been included above the title.
It is curious to note that this piece of pro-Jacobite, pro-Scottish literature was published in London, although the content may explain why it reached Scotland! The use of the Prince of Wales' crest, however, as a decorative motif for a pro-Jacobite song, seems a little controversial, and even dangerous. Anti-Jacobite feelings ran quite high until the tour of Scotland by George IV, in 1822.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The Landing of Royal Charlie',1830-1850
14748,ballad,L.C.Fol.73(125),"The lamentation begins: 'Come all you young people a warning take by us three, / We are unhappy creatures that are condemned to die, / All for that horrid murder that we have lately done. / On the body of Alexander Boyd on the twelfth day of June.' It was to be sung to the air, the 'Husband's Dream'. The text under the title informs the reader that the three accused were 'At present lying in Glasgow Jail, under the awful sentence of Death for the murder of / ALEXANDER BOYD, / In the New Vennel, Glasgow, on Sunday Morning, 12th June, 1853'.
The National Library of Scotland's collection also includes another broadside with two further lamentations regarding McFarlane, Blackwood and Young. Although they appear to have been written by the three culprits, it is very unlikely that they were. It was popular amongst broadside producers to print 'genuine' lamentations and last speeches in which the soon to be executed begged for God's forgiveness and fully repented their crimes. Such works not only provided entertainment for the readership, but were also thought to perform a valuable moral function.

I ha'e turn'd ower a that's in'd, / But ne'er a whittle can I find'. 'Whittle' is a Scots word for a sharp knife, and 'ripe' is Scots for 'search'. There are no publication details given on this broadside.
The comic nature of this poem is signified by the use of the word 'lamentation' in the title. Lamentations are generally songs or poems mourning the death or departure of a loved one, and to apply the term to a knife suggests an over-reaction to its loss. The comic melodrama increases throughout the poem, as the narrator first describes searching in vain for the knife and then imagines all sorts of fates for it. The poem culminates in a vision of the knife being unearthed in a peat bog and taken to Edinburgh as an antique, to be displayed proudly with William Wallace's relics.

14750,ballad,L.C.Fol.73(127a),"The lament reads: 'As I was walking one evening of late, / A Reverend old man I chanced for to meet ; / His name was Michael Taylor I must let you know, / But his fate was overshadowed with great grief and woe.' Taylor's lament was 'For his wife and daughter, who were cruelly poisened by the daughters husband, / DR PRITCHARD, / who is now lying under sentence of death, in the Prison of Glasgow to be executed on the 28th July, 1865.'
With its connection to the high profile case of Dr Edward William Pritchard, 'The Glasgow Poisoner', this broadside would have sold extremely well. Pritchard was arrested on the strength of an anonymous letter sent to the authorities, soon after which he was found guilty of murdering his wife and mother-in-law and sentenced to be hanged. Famously the last man to be publically executed in Scotland, Pritchard's hanging in Jail Square, Glasgow, is thought to have attracted a crowd of around 100,000 spectators.
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers. Crimes could generate sequences of sheets covering descriptive accounts, court proceedings, last words, lamentations and executions as they occurred. As competition was fierce, immediacy was paramount, and these occasions provided an opportunity for printers and patterers to maximise sales.",Broadside entitled 'The Lament of Mr Taylor',1865
14747,ballad,L.C.Fol.73(124),"The first lament begins: 'EACH feeling heart pray lend an ear / Unto this mournful tale, / It will draw a tear of sympathy, / I'm sure it cannot fail ; / It's of three wretched criminals, / In prison now we lie, / For the murder of Alexander Boyd / We are condemned to die.'
The second lament begins: 'GOOD people attend to our sad dismal tale, / And let our latter end be a warning to thee, / For base cruel murder we're doomed to suffer, / On the eleventh of August we must die on a tree.'
This broadside was printed in Glasgow and sold from premises at 203 Gallowgate. Two lamentations printed on one broadside would have been considered a bargain, and probably would have sold well. In 1853, Hans Smith McFarlane, Helen Blackwood and Ann Marshall or Young were charged with the murder of Alexander Boyd. Whilst McFarlane and Blackwood were found guilty and sentenced to be executed, Marshall was also found guilty but was recommended to mercy.","Broadside entitled 'Lament of Macfarlane, Blackwood and Young'",1853

It was advertised as a new song to an old tune and was to be sung to 'The Laird of Cockpen'.
This ballad is a parody of the popular song entitled the 'Laird o' Cockpen'. The original version is attributed to Lady Carolina Nairne (1766-1845) and begins: 'The Laird o' Cockpen, he's proud and he's great, / His mind is ta'en up wi' the things o' the state'. The melody of the same name, however, predates Lady Nairne's lyrics. The 'Laird' of the title, in this instance, is clearly standing for election and is not shown in a favourable light. Despite the omission of certain letters from his name, he would have been easily identifiable to the audience of the day.

' Below the title, it is recorded that 'This Popular Song can always be had at the Poet's Box Overgate Dundee'.
Set on a British ship, this ballad appears to be a song that criticises the existence of slavery in the United States. The sailors are sitting in a circle making conversation when a black man suddenly climbs up the ship's starboard side. After the escaped slave has shown the sailors the marks on his back where he was whipped, his master, the planter, arrives on deck. Noting the hostile atmosphere, however, the planter abandons the ship, leaving the former slave a free man. Britain abolished slavery in 1807, and throughout its empire in 1833, so this ballad may have been a propaganda piece written to show the British Empire in as favourable a light as possible.

This is an interesting broadside, not only because of the ballad it contains. At the top is an introduction to 'Jackie Tar' in the flamboyant style of Matthew Leitch, Poet's Box manager, after which he invites readers to visit and see his wares. 
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?!

In 1865, Dr Edward William Pritchard was found guilty of murdering his wife and mother-in-law and sentenced to be hanged. An anonymous letter alerted the police to the suspicious circumstances surrounding their deaths, and Pritchard's grisly role in their demise was soon uncovered.

The sheet does not contain any publication details, but a note beneath the title states that the song was 'Written and Composed expressly for Miss NELL MOONEY, by Mr James A. Kerr, Edinburgh.'
The title of this ballad, and the fact that it was to be sung to a tune called 'Pretty Nell',  suggests that it is an updated version of an older song. A character called 'Pretty Nell' does appear in an Irish folk song commonly known as 'The Handsome Cabin Boy' but it is is not possible to say with any certainty that that is the song referred to as 'Pretty Nell' on this broadside.

The meaning of this poem is not entirely clear, but it appears to be narrated by an Edinburgh prostitute. Although the term 'Knight' commonly refers to men, the phrase 'Knights of the Horn Order' may be a veiled reference to prostitutes. The narrator laments a lost, nobler, more chaste Scotland, and praises Bruce and Wallace. The references to these idols of Scottish independence, coupled with the early line 'Scotland has no name' suggests that this poem is a reaction to the 1707 Union of Parliaments, when Scotland was briefly rechristened 'North Britain'. It is implied that the Union has led to Scotland's moral decline.

Broadside sales were usually made on the street and were purchased mainly from sellers or chapmen. They often sang the songs or chanted the titles out to attract attention. That in itself must have been a colourful entertainment!
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

The second ballad begins: 'On August twall frae Aiberdeen, / We sailed on board the Prince'. The third ballad begins: 'One day as I was walking, and as I did pass, / On the banks of Inverurie I met a bonnie lass'. The fourth ballad begins: ''Twas in the month of sweet July, / Before the sun had pierced the sky'.
This sheet was published and distributed by the Poet's Box of the Overgate, Dundee. There was sometimes an attempt by publishers, with broadsides that featured more than one ballad, to group similar songs together. This particular sheet, however, covers a vast array of themes. The first song touches on the heroic actions of Scottish soldiers at Lucknow, during the Indian Mutiny (1857-8), whilst the 'Lothian Hairst' revolves around a group of seasonal workers. The last two songs featured both touch upon the familiar themes of love and elopement.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

It was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow, and includes a woodcut illustration of a woman sweeping a floor.
Unusually, this ballad highlights the daily toils of women. It takes the form of a list detailing every chore a woman has to complete, while her husband is out at work. There are numerous examples in the National Library of Scotland's collection of broadsides that portray women as lazy, drunken and deceitful, but very few that present womankind in a more positive light. This rare example offers what is probably a very truthful representation of daily life for the average woman in nineteenth-century Scotland.

The second ballad begins: 'By Killarney's lakes and fells, / Emerald isles and winding bays, / Mountain paths and woodland dells, / Memory ever fondly strays.' This sheet was published by James Kay of Glasgow and would have sold for a penny.
James Kay mainly worked as a printer and kept premises on Argyll Street. This was away from Glasgow's main business area for book production in and around the Saltmarket. The reasons for, and effect of this, are simply not recorded. Kay was working from these premises during the 1840s and so it is likely that this sheet was published during this time.",Broadside ballads entitled 'The Knight Templar's dream' and 'Killarney's lakes and fells',1840-1850

A note below the title states that this ballad should be sung to the tune of  'Let Mary live long'.
This ballad takes the form of a letter written by James II, King of England (1633-1701) to Louis XIV, King of France (1638-1715), who had the reputation of being a warmonger. As King James was only on the throne from 1685-1688, it seems likely that the ballad was written during this period. With its reference to the battleground of Flanders, the ballad states that the countries of Europe are tired of war and asks Louis - the 'Sun King' - to lay down his arms. As James and Louis shared the same Catholic religion, the lines regarding James's children holding out the 'olive branch' to Louis, seems to be a confident prediction that James's children will successfully accede to the English throne following their father's death, thus continuing the Stewart dynasty.

The text preceding this reads: 'Sung with unbounded applause by S-r T.D.L-r, Bart, at a late Whig Dinner. / TUNE - ""Derry down""'. Parts of an 'Old Song' have been included at the bottom of the sheet, which was published by Butler of Edinburgh.
Broadsides were cheaply produced and easily available and as a result they reached a wide audience, comprising a variety of people. There are many Whig-themed broadsides held in the National Library of Scotland's collection and the party seemed to have made full use of the printing and distribution facilities available at the time. It is curious to note, however, that the number of enfranchised citizens previous to 1833 was only 6% of the population and that by 1833 this had only grown to 12%. It makes a lot of this publicity appear a little needless, as not many people were involved in the voting procedure.

This broadside was published by W.R. Walker of Royal Arcade, Newcastle, and sold by B. Stewart of Botchergate, Carlisle.
The woodcut illustrating this broadside shows a Scottish Highland soldier and a tartan-clad woman with a spinning wheel. The picture has no discernible connection to 'Kathleen O'More', which is a song narrated by an unidentified man lamenting the death of his sweetheart. The choice of illustration, particularly coming from an English publisher, suggests the extent to which Scottish Highland imagery became associated with romantic tragedy after the international successes of James Macpherson's 'Ossian' poems and Sir Walter Scott's 'Waverley' novels in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries.

The sheet was originally published and sold in 1858 by the Poet's Box of St Andrew's Lane, Glasgow, but the address has been obscured and stamp for the Dundee Poet's Box put on the top left, indicating that Oates 'inherited' the sheet. The song is to be sung to the strangely-entitled air of 'Hokee pokee wonkee fum'.
This ballad was written at a high-point of British Imperialism, and is a telling illustration of the superior attitudes which popularly existed among both those Brits who settled abroad, in countries such as Africa, and also among the broadside-buying public back in Scotland. As with another broadside in the National Library of Scotland's collection, 'The Queen of Otaheite', the 'natives' are portrayed as bigamous cannibals, with little regard for Western ways.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box.

Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day. Cheaply available, they were sold on the streets by pedlars and chapmen.

This broadside was published by Robert McIntosh of 9 King Street, Calton, in Glasgow. It is not dated.
The nine muses, which are invoked in the first line of this ballad, are the Greek goddesses of arts, culture and learning. The ancient Greeks believed that the muses inspired all poetry, music and art, and for centuries it has been a tradition for poets to acknowledge the muses, or to ask the muses for help, in their work. Thus references to the muses can be found in some of the greatest and most ambitious poetic works ever created, but also in much more modest poems and songs such as 'Johnie's Lamentation'.

There are no publication details included on this sheet.
This amusing ballad, in its highlighting of the infuriating way in which politicians refuse to give straight answers to questions, will strike a chord with today's voters. In his exasperation, the writer deploys the famous French phrase, 'juste milieu' ('the happy medium'), to demonstrate how politicians at this time operated in the no-man's land between 'yes' and 'no', when answering questions. The ballad was likely written during the 1830s, when the boundaries between the various political parties became famously blurred. Indeed, the National Library of Scotland's collection includes many broadsides from around this period that highlight the way in which electoral candidates did not always represent what they claimed to represent.

It was published and distributed by the Poet's Box, and probably sold for one penny.
The address of the Poet's Box - 80 London Street, Glasgow - has been scored out. This is very likely because they moved premises a number of times, and did not want to dispose of their old stock. The National Library of Scotland's collection includes a large number of broadsides published by the Poet's Box. Although this particular sheet was clearly printed in Glasgow, there were also Poet's Boxes in Edinburgh, Dundee and Paisley. Information on their origins is sketchy, however, and it is unclear whether the different establishments were connected in any way other than by name.

The ballad itself begins: 'NO more this aged Sinner cheats the Tree, / Or swings a Helter round him wi' a Swie'. Unfortunately, no publication details are included on the sheet.
This broadside tells the sad story of James Inglis or Clipstir, who was to be executed for stealing sheep and horses. Employing quite poetic imagery in its telling of this sad tale, the writer rejoices in the fact that, after a period of 40 years, the law has finally caught up with Inglis. So the tone of the ballad is very much that of a notorious criminal receiving his comeuppance. It appears that many of his crimes took place in the countryside around Edinburgh, since Haddington and Dirleton are both mentioned in the ballad. The mentioning of John Dalglish also helps the modern-day reader place an approximate date on the sheet, since Dalglish was a well-known executioner in Edinburgh during the early eighteenth century.

Verse 1: 'FAREWEL to Lochaber, and farewel my Jean, / Where heartsom with thee I've mony a Day been; / For Lochaber no more, Lochaber no more, / We'll may be return to Lochaber no more.' This should be sung 'To the tune of Lochaber no more'.
Despite appearing on the same broadside, these two songs are very different in content. Alaster Mackalaster's life, crimes, capture and sentence are described in brisk, unsentimental tones by a narrator who feels that the manner of Mackalaster's death was 'too good' for him. By contrast, 'A New Song' is a lament by a Scottish sailor for his home region of Lochaber, and for Jean, the woman he left there.",Broadside ballads entitled 'The Life and Tragical End of Alaster Mackalaster' and 'A New Song',1723

The topic of love and the sweetness of a lover are very popular broadside themes and must have provided compelling escapism.

Below the title we are told that 'This Popular Song can always be had at the Poet's Box, 224 OVERGATE, DUNDEE', and at the foot of the sheet a mail order service for other publications is advertised. 'Toomed' means 'emptied', 'coggies' is a 'cog of beer' and 'ferlie' means 'wonder'.
With an element of Burns's 'Tam O'Shanter' about it, this light-hearted ballad tells the practical joke played upon John Tamson by his despairing wife, Jean. Fond of his beer, it seems that John quite often fell asleep when travelling back from the fair in his cart, since the horse knew its way home without his guidance. On this occasion, however, the horse also falls asleep, leaving both of them stranded. Wondering what has happened to him, Jean goes out to find husband and horse both sound asleep. To teach him a lesson, she leads the horse home, leaving John to go searching for the horse once he wakes up.

Part of a sequence of broadsides dedicated to the Gilmerton murder, this sheet follows the news and investigative reports of the murder with a ballad of doggerel verses. It is likely that this ballad would have been read out by someone who had a gift for dramatic storytelling, while members of the public gathered round to listen to the narrator. The ballad itself is very religious in tone, with numerous references to the Almighty and the conflict between good and evil. It would appear that after the initial reports of an event had been published, it was customary to quickly follow them with a ballad specially dedicated to the subject.

The intertextual title for this lyrical ballad comes from a song by William Balfe with words by Alfred Bunn.

The writer of this romantic ballad employs the central image of a lily of the valley, a symbol for innocence and purity, to convey an impression of the loveliness that his recently deceased sweetheart embodied. So the flower imagery employed in this song of mourning is in fact a symbol for the dead woman - the two entities of lily and dead lover being entwined together by the grieving narrator.

The chorus reads: 'And heedless by the lily stray, / Which blossoms in our way.'
This short song is one of at least two which appeared on the same broadside, thereby offering the purchaser value for money. It is thought that the author of 'Life Let us Cherish' was the Swiss-born poet, Johann Martin Usteri (1763-1827). Whether he was responsible for the first verse or the entire composition is unclear. It does, however, offer the reader a simple but profound message: 'Away with every toil and care, / And cease the rankling thorn to wear, / With manful heart the conflict meet, / Till death sounds his retreat.'

As was noted along the top of this sheet, this eulogy was penned by Robert Sempill of Beltrees, Renfrewshire (c.1595-1665).
Habbie Simpson, famed in his time both for his musical talent and his outstanding personality, lived in Kilbarchan, Renfrewshire in the late 16th century. There are other sheets held in the National Library of Scotland's collection which give further details of his life. The lyrics themselves became influential in Scots poetry as the style, known as the 'Standard Habbie' was adopted by Fergusson (1750-74) and Burns (1759-96) for non-eulogy poems.

The ballad was to be sung to the tune of 'The Ladies Daughter'. Although it may appear that this verse is unfinished, 'with a' is more likely the poet's or printer's orthography for withal, meaning besides or as well.
This ballad is the story of a dog that has a predilection for killing sheep rather than hunting wild animals, and which is eventually beheaded for its crimes. These are not the only Scottish verses to deal with the public execution of a dog: 'The Dying Words of Bonnie Heck, a Greyhound in the Shire of Fife' is an anonymous pastiche on broadsides that printed the supposed last speeches of condemned criminals. It is narrated by a greyhound that is about to be hanged.

'H-----r' should be taken to be 'Hanover'. Directly under the title it reads: 'Peers, Gentlemen, give Audience, To Fable ta'en from Common Sense'.
Robert the Raven is a pseudonym for the English whig statesman Sir Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Oxford (1676-1745), who is generally considered to be the first prime minister of Great Britain. He presided over the Governments of George I and George II, and wielded a tremendous amount of power and influence. Considered by many to be a corrupt and calculating man, many of the allegations included in this broadside appear to have been true. Finally, 'A Grand fowl bred up at  H-----r', refers to King George I, the first Hanoverian king of Great Britain, who was famously disinterested in British affairs and left the running of the country to his ministers.

This broadside ballad claims to be written from the viewpoint of Mrs McLeod, who was sentenced to death for committing forgery. In contrast to another broadside on the same subject in which she protests her innocence, this sheet provides readers with a detailed inventory of her crimes. The answer to this puzzle is that Mrs McLeod most likely did not write either of these broadsides. Instead, both sheets were probably written by experienced broadside writers who knew that crime sells and were looking for different angles on the same story. These broadsides are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

Although this broadside looks as if it contains humorous verses spoken by a Doctor John Dalgeish and his patient, Mrs McLeod, the doctor in question is in fact a hangman. Mrs McLeod was executed in Edinburgh in 1727 for the crime of forgery, and John Dalgeish was a well-known hangman. People reading and hearing the broadside then would have been aware of this fact, and would have enjoyed the jesting tone and conceit of this piece. As the insults increase in number and severity, the final verse reaches its climax when Doctor Dalgeish tells Mrs McLeod that she will soon be swinging on the scaffold.

The inspiration for this farcical ballad is not very clear. 'Bogs' is a Scots word for 'bugs', and it may be that the ballad was written to commemorate the burning of a house in Edinburgh's Pleasance that had become infested with some sort of bloodsucking insect or pest. This ballad is a parody of those that were written and published on broadsides describing the last words of condemned criminals.

With references to 'the Ganges' bank', 'the Sirdar's horsemen', and a 'Siva-charmed sword', it is possible this ballad revolves around events during the Indian Mutiny, otherwise known as India's First War of Independence (1857-8). Following the mutiny, in which Indian soldiers or sepoys in the service of the British East India Company challenged British rule in India, control of the subcontinent passed from the Company to the British Government. Although the British, using extreme measures, managed to quash the uprising, they were unable to eradicate the bitter resentment felt by many Indians towards their presence there.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

'Leader-haughs and Yarrow' is one of the very few great Scots ballads attributed to a specific person. The supposed author Nicol Burne of Selkirkshire is reputed to have been a foundling brought back to Scotland by the warrior, Wat O' Harden, after a raid on Northumberland. The poem's date of origin is unknown, but surviving copies in the National Library of Scotland are from c.1690-1701.
'Leader-haughs and Yarrow' is more ambitious poetically than most ballads.

This poem was written by Robert Sempill of Beltrees, Renfrewshire (c.1595-1659). This poem became very important in the history of Scots literature as it resurrects an old verse form, but for a eulogy for the first time. The verse is called 'Standard Habbie', from the title, and consists of six lines. The first, second, third and fifth lines have 4 beats and rhyme, while the fourth and sixth lines have 2 beats and rhyme. The stanza was elaborated on by Allan Ramsay (1685-1758) and Robert Fergusson (1750-74) but it was most widely used by Robert Burns (1759-96). As a result it is sometimes known by the alternative title of 'Burns Stanza'. There is no date and publisher attached to this sheet but the continual reprinting of the song has ensured its survival.

The ballad was to be sung to the tune of 'Clavers and his Highland Men'.
'The Lasses of Kinghorn' tells the tale of a young chapman, or book-pedlar, who is captured by the army then rescued by the women of Kinghorn, who attack and outfight the army regiment holding the chapman. The ballad is a knockabout comic tale mocking the army, but the circumstances underlying it are more serious. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were times of civil war in Britain, and book-pedlars would have played their part in distributing polemic for the various factions.

The first line of Tytler's version is, 'I hae laid a herring in saut', and the older version begins, 'I ha'e layen three herrings a-sa't'.

Tytler also completed the significant task of single-handedly editing and revising the Encyclopedia Britannica.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?!

This solemn ballad tells of a young man's desire to die the - supposedly - glorious death of a soldier, while fighting on some battlefield. The shifting narrative viewpoint of the ballad is quite interesting, switching from the young man himself to the anonymous narrator. Although not especially interesting, this ballad does at least reveal that the young men of this era aspired to be soldiers, and that joining the armed forces was a common way of earning a living. Alternatively, it could instead be argued that the establishment wished the country's young men to think that dying a soldier's death was a noble objective that was well worth achieving.

This ballad tells the sad story of Jamie MacPherson, who was hung for committing various crimes in 1700. Although MacPherson was guilty of some of the crimes, it is claimed that it was really political intrigue that sealed his fate. Legend has it that he read out his farewell poem on the scaffold, then played an original tune of his own on the fiddle. After finishing the tune, he offered the fiddle to the crowd. As no-one came forward to claim it, however, he smashed the fiddle, then was executed. This fiddle is on display in the Clan MacPherson museum in Newtonmore, Inverness-shire. The song, 'MacPherson's Farewell', by Robert Burns, is based on this incident.

This appears to be a broadside publication of a story by David Macbeth Moir (1798-1851), that was probably originally published in Blackwood's Magazine. Moir, from Musselburgh, worked as a doctor but was also a keen writer of prose and poetry. Between 1824 and 1827 he contributed a series of stories about his fictional creation Mansie Waugh or Wauch to Blackwood's Magazine, and these were published in a single volume in 1828. This was prior to Burke's execution, and it seems that for this tale, Moir revived his popular character as a reaction to the huge interest surrounding the Burke and Hare murders.
Burke and Hare were Irish bodysnatchers and murderers, who worked around Edinburgh's Canongate area, eventually becoming local legends. They hit upon the idea of murdering solitary or vulnerable people (in an attempt not to get caught) so that they could sell the bodies for dissection. Hare turned King's Evidence and so was acquitted, but this secured the conviction of Burke, who was hanged on the 28th January 1829.","Broadside entitled 'Mansie Waugh's Dream Concerning the Execution of Burke, Parts First and Second'",1829

The tune for O'Donnell Abu was composed in the early part of the 19th century by Joseph Haliday, a man from Carrick-on-Suir, Co. Tipperary. He was bandmaster of the Cavan militia. Michael McCann, a young Galway man, added words to the music. The composition first appeared  in 'The Nation' of January, 1843 and was then called 'The Clan Connell War Song'.",Broadside ballads entitled 'The Marble Arch' and 'O'Donnell Aboo',1860-1890

This song is addressed to the river Rhine. The narrator praises the beauty of its mountains and dales, and the richness and fertility of its valley, yet confesses that he will only be happy to live on its banks if he can win the heart of 'the maid of the Rhine'. Poems and songs addressing and praising some non-human aspect of nature have probably existed for as long as music and literature have been created. It is very common for this appreciation of nature to be bound up in some way with a human romantic dilemma, as in this song.

Published in Dundee by the Poet's Box, the song was apparently 'Sung with great success by Miss G. Forrester'. It is possible that Miss Forrester was a local celebrity, and by using her name the publisher hoped to sell more copies.
Although he is not credited here, 'MacGregor's Gathering' is one of Sir Walter Scott's (1771-1832) most famous poems. It was written in 1816, but it is possible that this broadside is of a later date. The titles of the songs at the bottom of the sheet give a clue, 'The Wondrous Telephone' and 'The Iron Horse' suggest that this is a late-nineteenth century broadside.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson. 
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information  such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day. Cheaply available, they were sold on the streets by pedlars and chapmen.

'The Little Gypsy Girl' begins: 'My father is a king of the gypsies, 'tis true, / And my mother is learning the camping to do, / With my pack on my back, they all wished me well, / When I set off for London, some fortunes to tell...'
This broadside would have been considered good value, as it contains two ballads instead of the standard one and is illustrated with a woodcut. The two poems are quite different in nature, although both touch on popular ballad themes. 'A Man that is Married' jokingly warns men about the terrible toll marriage will take on wallets and lifestyles. 'The Little Gypsy Girl' is a fantasy about a young gypsy who marries a wealthy squire after foretelling that their destiny is to be together.",Broadside ballads entitled 'A Man that is Married' and 'The Little Gypsy Girl',1880-1900

This song is still very well known today, but first gained popularity in British music halls of the nineteenth century. It is believed to have been inspired by Joseph Hobson Jagger, an engineer from Little Horton in Bradford, who won one million pounds playing roulette in Monte Carlo in  July, 1875. Jagger died in 1892 and is buried in Bethel graveyard, between Bradford and Halifax. The song was written by Fred Gilbert and popularised by Charles Coburn.

It was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow, and includes a woodcut illustration of a small house situated in a clearing.
This particular woodcut illustration was used by Lindsay on a number of different broadsides, including one featuring the song 'Annie Laurie'. It was common practice for broadside producers to reuse their often limited stock of woodcuts. In many cases, the illustration bore little or no relation to the subject, and was merely added as a selling point.

Below the title, a note states that the sheet was published by Charles Pigott of 52 Compton Street, Clerkenwell, London. A 'hawling shaker' is a Scots expression for 'tramp'.
There are a number of variations regarding the proper title for this traditional song, which was popular in London at the beginning of the eighteenth century and featured in 'The Quaker's Opera' in 1728. It is believed that the original version of the ballad was written in 1642 by Francis Sempill (1616-1682), although many musicians and poets - including Robert Burns - later embellished the song. Most versions of the song tell how Maggy was seduced and made pregnant by a piper from Fife called, in this case, 'Rob the Ranter'.

Luckie Gibson was an Edinburgh bawd, or brothel keeper. The piece is written in the first person, implying Gibson wrote it herself. It seems more likely, however, that it was written after her death, commissioned by her friends or perhaps written by one of them, for it shows a lot of affection for the woman and her enterprise.

Many of the broadsides which now reside in the National Library of Scotland's collection appear to have had their publication details either blacked out or cut out. This is especially true of sheets published by the Poet's Box chain of printers and distributors. Although the reason for this is unclear, one suggestion is that the sheets were excess stock which were sold on. The next seller then had to erase the original details.

Lurgan, County Amagh, is featured in many broadside ballads, mainly in conjunction with travelling and emigration. This ballad, however, focuses on returning to find an old flame at the height of summer's bloom - so the atmosphere is one of hope and tranquillity.

'Lucky Spence's Last Advice' parodies the broadside publications of 'last words' or 'Dying advice', which offered moral instruction and were often imputed to condemned criminals although more likely composed by the broadside author. The narrator, Lucky Spence, is a brothel-keeper, and her advice consists mainly of instructing her 'girls' how best to exploit the hypocritical Edinburgh figures of authority who are their best clients. The verse form is 'Standard Habbie', derived from the influential Scots comic ballad 'The Life and Death of Habbie Simpson, Piper in Kilbarchan' written in the seventeenth century by Robert Sempill (c.1595-c.1665) of Beltrees.

This broadside does not carry the name of its publisher, nor the place or date of publication.
'The Lowland Lovers' is a song narrated by a woman whose sweetheart has joined the navy and gone to sea. Love and separation are common themes in broadside ballads, and the separation usually involves a woman being left at home while her husband or fiancé either emigrates to find work, or joins the armed forces. It is ironic that, although in these ballads the army and navy seem to steal the men away, in some other ballads soldiers and sailors are portrayed as romantic heroes or figures of desire.

This ballad follows a religious dispute between two young lovers. It is presented as if overheard by a third party. Whilst Johnny declares himself a Roman Catholic and accuses Nancy of heresy, she denounces the Church of Rome and maintains her loyalty to Luther and Protestantism. After threatening to leave Johnny, Nancy is suddenly overcome with loyalty and chooses to forego her faith for him. This ballad illustrates well the age-old tensions that existed between Roman Catholics and Protestants.

'Lord Beigham' tells the story of a seafaring nobleman who makes a vow of marriage to a Turkish woman who saves his life, then almost forgets his promise. Ballads which combined romance with travel and adventure were always popular, and 'Lord Beigham' was undoubtedly reprinted on several occasions. Another version is held in Glasgow University Library as part of the Murray Collection, a collection of several hundred nineteenth-century broadside ballads amassed by a Glasgow solicitor, David Murray.

There are a number of different versions of this old ballad, in which the enemy changes nationality from Spanish to French or even Turkish. Also, in some, the young boy is wrapped up in a bearskin before he jumps overboard. They all, however, conclude with the betrayal of the boy. As part of the oral tradition, ballads were passed from person to person down through the generations and were never intended to be written down. Naturally, with each retelling slight variations or embellishments often crept in. This organic process helped to breathe new life into ancient but timeless works.

It includes a decorative border and slogans supporting the Earl.
At a time of great political reform, when people were protesting against the power of the landed classes, it is quite interesting to find this tribute to a member of one of the most powerful landed families in Scotland. The song appears to be a pastiche of Sir Walter Scott's 'Blue Bonnets Over the Border', the chorus of which begins: 'March! March! Ettrick and Teviotdale'.

This should be sung 'To the tune of Robin Hood and the Tanner'. The 'three Horn'd Beasts' are named as 'John Forbes, Master Duncan Lidel, / With his sone George to tune their fidle.'
This ballad appears to be part of a debate about the proper dates of religious fairs and festivals. The author mocks John Forbes, Duncan Lidel and George Lidel for wanting 'three score' days in Lent, and makes numerous references to the Jewish calendar to support his argument that the status quo is correct. There appears to be a regional element to this argument, the 'horn'd beasts' being scholars in Aberdeen while the author appears to favour Edinburgh.

The original poem was written by Thomas Campbell (1777-1844), about Donald Cameron of Lochiel (c.1700- 48), who was a highly-regarded Highland chief, and supporter of the Jacobite cause.
This piece cleverly adapts Campbell's original 1802 text, making it applicable to an Inverness-shire Parliamentary election. It takes the form of a dialogue between a nineteenth-century Lochiel, Donald Cameron of Lochiel, M.P., and a Wizard. They discuss the merits of the incumbent Tory M.P., Sir Kenneth Mackenzie of Gairloch. Lochiel is poked fun at in various ways, and the device of allowing him to speak for himself cleverly lets him show up his own hypocrisy and corrupt nature, e.g. 'I have marshalled my clan, With coaxing and threatening they'll plump to a man'.
This style of text, with its implicit political propaganda, would not only have made for compelling entertainment, but would also perhaps have stimulated political thought, reasoning and debate.

The patterers and pedlars who wandered the towns and countryside selling broadsides ballads, often sang the songs to encourage people to buy a sheet.

'Lottie Lane' is a touching but unremarkable song mourning the death of a loved one. Of more historical interest is some of the text surrounding the poem. Although the city of publication has been obscured in this broadside, the additional text matches text in broadsides from the Glasgow Poet's Box that are held by the National Library of Scotland. The Glasgow Poet's Box was not only a publisher and supplier of broadsides: as the adverstisement reveals here, it would also provide 'Letters and Petitions?on the most moderate terms'. In an era when adult literacy was lower than it is today, this was an important service.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

One day while working at the plough, / Fal, lal, &c. / I felt just here I can't tell how, / Fal, lal, &c. / I turned my head round, just to see / who 'twas I heard, when there stood thee, / Like Venus com'd out of the Sea. / Fal, lal, &c.' This ballad was to be sung to the tune 'Blue Tailed Fly'.
This song is structured as a flirtatious dialogue between a young farmer, Honest John, and a pretty young woman, Nan. Nan plays off John's proposal against another she has received from a rich squire, and tells John that a magpie has flattered her about the squire's attentions. In Britain the magpie is traditionally rumoured to have Satanic qualities, so this is a bad omen. Eventually, in increasingly short and frantic exchanges, John convinces Nan to marry him instead. At the climax to the song, both turn to the audience to tell them to ensure that honesty and love conquer the devil and jealousy.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing.

'Feyther's Old Sow' begins: 'Good morrow, Miss Biddy, pray how do you do / I dare say you gusses at what I become about'. The broadside was published by Harkness, printer, of Church Street in Preston. It does not carry a date of publication.
'Loch na Garr' was written by George Gordon, Lord Byron (1788-1824), a poet of huge international renown. Byron passed the first ten years of his life in Aberdeen and spent holidays in a farm in Deeside, which gave him a love of the Aberdeenshire countryside that is celebrated in this poem. Lochnagar, the mountain that gives this poem its title, was also the inspiration for a picture book, 'The Old Man of Lochnagar', written by Prince Charles in the 1970s. The author of 'Feyther's Old Sow' is not printed on the sheet, but it is probably safe to assume it was not written by Lord Byron!

The spelling in this ballad is inconsistent, which is not uncommon in broadsides. The word 'fairy' is spelt two ways: as in the title (which is probably a misprint), and as 'farey'. Morag's Fairy Glen is still a popular attraction in Dunoon, Argyllshire, and was gifted to the town in 1929. Although not mentioned here, the song was written by William Cameron (1801-77).

Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills.

This should be sung 'To the Tune of Wo's my Heart that we should sinder'. Here 'sinder' is the poet's or printer's orthography for sunder, meaning to part.
This ballad is narrated by a man who regrets the fact that his marriage has failed because of his wife's jealousy. Throughout the poem he maintains that he has remained faithful, and that his wife's jealousy is unfounded. Initially it seems that the narrator is merely lamenting parting from his wife, but by verses ten and eleven a more tragic aspect emerges, as it becomes apparent that this ballad is a suicide note: 'But yet alas! I must be gone, / I'm glad to die before we sinder.'

This rather strange story would no doubt have been highly entertaining at the time it was sold - given the lack of other diversionary activities available. It tells the story of the miller, Halbert, his beautiful young wife, Bess, and the local priest - who all three enjoy a close relationship. The nature of the relations, however, are revealed when a student and stranger catches the priest courting Bess. The student James, then takes advantage of Halbert's ignorance to perform 'magic' tricks for the miller!

Whilst the first song has been attributed to the prolific Amercian songwriter and journalist, William Shakepseare Hays (1837-1907), it is unclear whether 'Mother Take Me Home Again' was also one of his compositions. Written in a very similar style, however, it does appear likely that it was.

A note below the title states that this ballad was 'Sung by Harry Russell, with great success', and that 'Copies of this popular song can always be had at the POET'S BOX, Overgaie, Dundee'.
This morose ballad tells of the writer's despairing belief that money ends up corrupting everything and everyone - a reversal of the King Midas touch, as it were. To illustrate his bitter argument, the writer highlights a number of episodes to prove that, tragically, everyone has their price, and that money all too often usurps our abstract worldly possessions of real value such as love and friendship. The manner in which 'M-O-N-E-Y' is spelt out is quite eye and ear-catching, and suggests that the narrator of the ballad would have spelt the word out to his audience for dramatic effect, with a strong emphasis on each letter.

This ballad was to be sung 'To an Excellent New Tune', and was published by John Moncur of Sclater's Close, Edinburgh, in 1707.
This ballad celebrates the advantages of moderate drinking, such as inspiring convivial company or giving courage to soldiers and courting men, yet warns the listener against drinking to excess. The advice seems to have fallen on deaf ears: Edinburgh was famous for its public houses and gentlemen's clubs, and the three greatest Scots poets of the eighteenth century, Allan Ramsay, Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns, all wrote extensively in praise of drink.

A handwritten annotation at the foot of the broadside suggested that it was published in Edinburgh on the 16th of April 1728. The price and publisher are not noted.
This 'merry dialogue' between two prisoners in Edinburgh's tolbooth is structured like a 'flyting', a Scots poetic mode wherein two rivals attack each other in verse. Of the two rivals, Tonny Ashton and John Curry, a handwritten annotation under the title reveals: 'The former being imprisioned Apr 1728 with his son Walter for the said Walters Inticaing and Marriaing Mrs Joan Ker. Little is known about Curry but Aston was an English actor who had come to Edinburgh in the 1720s. He had incurred the wrath of the Master of Revels by failing to pay dues he owed and by continuing to perform in spite of a prohibition.  After a spell of litigation, Aston cut his losses and left Edinburgh in 1728.

The text beneath the title reads: 'Sung by Harry Melville and J.M. Oates with success.' The song was published by the Poet's Box, 10 Hunter Street, Dundee, priced one penny.
This comic ballad describes a monstrous Christmas cake that poisons everyone who eats it. Although the broadside was apparently published in Dundee, some surnames and phrases in the ballad suggest that it is about a group of Irish acquaintances. The large number of Irish-themed broadsides found in Scotland reflects the high level of Irish migration to Scotland during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As a major urban industrial centre, Dundee become home to a large Irish migrant population.

'The Milking Pail' is a song celebrating the beauty of milkmaids above all other women, and attributing this beauty to the health-giving properties of the countryside.

This love song was written by William Cameron (1801-77), who was born in Stirling but worked as a pawnbroker in Glasgow. Cameron wrote many songs and poems, and his work is notable for its celebration of the beauty of nature and the Scottish countryside. As well as living in Glasgow, Cameron owned a cottage in Dunoon called 'Gowan Lea'. 'Gowan' is a Scots word commonly referring to a wild daisy, although it is also occasionally used to denote the buttercup. A 'lea' is a meadow or unploughed field that has been left to grass.

The use of the word licence in the introduction to this ballad is quite interesting. Licences were usually only issued where tax payments were due, such as on newspapers, and broadsides were untaxed. Often 'licence' is used to mean entered in the Stationers' Registry. This gave publishers some measure of copyright protection. On a further note, this statement was sometimes included even when the text had not been registered, as a measure of low-cost  protection.

This song was published by the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee, and priced at one penny.
This haunting ballad appears to be a love song addressed to a woman. The narrator requests a meeting with the addressee in a grove by moonlight. In the most memorable image of the song, the woman is described as the queen of the night flowers. It is suggested there is a gravity and seriousness about the narrator's love for the woman that is better suited to night: 'Daylight may do for the gay, / The thoughtless, the heartless, the free; / But there's something about the moon's ray; / That is sweeter to you and to me.'

Broadside authors tended to see themselves as moral guardians and teachers in society. As such, publishers often disseminated 'educational' texts involving life lessons and advice. There are a few broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's Collection which are written from a horse's point of view, which may appear odd. Horses, however, were really the only means of long-distance travel and heavy haulage. Horse drivers were also renowned for their poverty and outrageous drinking habits.

This ballad derives its humour from Lowland perceptions of Scottish Highlanders. Highland pronounciation of English is rendered with comical exaggeration. The stereotypes of Highlanders being warlike and brave, but also dedicated cattle drovers, are combined to humorous effect when MacPherson's men desert him to go and drive the cattle, leaving him to be killed. The Highlander's alleged prediliction for whisky is also mocked. While authors like Walter Scott and James MacPherson romanticised the Highlands, satire like this was also common, even in the work of famous poets like Robert Fergusson.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were.

It was published by James Lindsay, 9 King Street, Glasgow, and includes a woodcut illustration.
This ballad follows Flora as she desperately tries to find her lover, Donald, following the the Massacre of Glencoe. In the ballad tradition, Flora, upon finding her lover's body, dies of a broken heart: 'She fell on his body, and then did expire'. In February 1692, members of the Macdonald clan were brutally murdered for refusing to pledge allegiance to King William III. Campbell soldiers, acting on behalf of the government, murdered the clan chief, Alexander MacDonald of Glenoce, and around thirty of his men. Hundreds of MacDonald men, women and children fled to the hills for safety.

The lyrics for this ballad were written in 1772 by John Lowe. Lowe was tutor to the McGhie family, and wrote the song for Mary, one of the daughters. She had been engaged to a surgeon named Alexander (Sandy) Miller who was lost at sea. Lowe ended up in America, working first as tutor for George Washington's brother's family, then running an academy in Virginia. He later became an Anglican minister.

There are no publication details attached to this sheet, but a woodcut illustration has been included at the top of the sheet. It shows a young fishwife, standing on a beach, with her nets.
The narrator of this piece is reminiscing over his encounter with Mary, which occurred along the banks of the River Don. The woodcut at the top of the sheet does help enhance the understanding of the text, and would have been especially attractive to members of the audience who were illiterate or only semi-literate. The girl is intended to be young and comely. Her station and vocation in life and the nature of area, with the allusion to the beach and nets, are all clearly expressed here.

15797,ballad,Ry.III.a.10(079),"This ballad is divided into two named parts. The first part of the ballad is called 'The Meal Mongers intreagues and Resolutions', while the second half of the ballad is called 'The Buyers Answer'. The opening line of the first part reads: 'COME Willie I'll tell you the news'. In the second part of the ballad, the opening line is: 'Fire Brands of Satan are you then Resolv'd'. The first part of the ballad was sung to the tune of 'The meal was dear short-fine', while the second part of the ballad is sung to the tune of 'Death and the Lady'.
As a meal-monger was one who deals in meal, the setting for his ballad would have been that of a busy marketplace. While the meal-monger tells the buyer that his meal is of excellent quality, the buyer replies that the price he is charging amounts to extortion and that his meal is of poor quality. The price of meal was of vital importance in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, and many of the riots that took place during this era were food riots. This form of 'expostulation and reply' poetic structure, was a common literary device during this era.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day. Cheaply available, they were sold on the streets by pedlars and chapmen. Broadsides offer a valuable insight into many aspects of the society they were published in, and the National Library of Scotland holds over 250,000 of them.",Broadside ballad in two parts entitled 'The Meal Mongers Garland',1701-

Relationships between the sexes are a very common subject in contemporary songs, and this was also the case with broadside ballads. The tone of such ballads could vary from deeply romantic to bawdy. 'Mary Mackree' is of the bawdier variety, describing how a maid is seduced by the son of her employer, who visits the maid's bedroom under the pretence of bringing her a posset to help her recover from an illness.

This ballad is to be sung to the tune of 'Braes of Strathblane'. It was published by Brown and Son, of 56 Trongate and 25 Nelson Street, Glasgow. A woodcut of the Ark adorns the top of the sheet.
This ballad tells the, probably true, story of Margaret Bell, from Renfrewshire, who fell pregnant and was treated very badly by the father. The devil whispered to her to kill her baby, as a way out of the abject poverty she found herself in. For this she was sentenced to be hung, but the locals took pity on her and petitioned for a lesser sentence. Margaret Bell was transported instead.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.",Broadside ballad entitled 'Margaret Bell's Lament',1853

It was published by Robert McIntosh of King Street, Calton, Glasgow, and includes an illustration at the top of the sheet.
This tragic ballad tells of the eviction of Mary Le More and her family, and how they suffered at the hands of a band of brutal soldiers. The work is now widely attributed to the Liverpool abolitionist poet Edward Rushton (1756-1814). In a collection of his poems published in 1806 Rushton covered the story of Mary in three poems. The second of the three poems in the 1806 edition, titled 'The Maniac', is reproduced here with the title 'Mary Le More'. The poem has also in the past been attributed to the Irish-born ballad-writer George Nugent Reynolds (1770-1802) and the Scottish poet Thomas Campbell (1777-1844).

It has been suggested, due to this sheet's place in its collection, that it was published in Glasgow in 1701. This is, however, now completely unverifiable. The lyrics to this piece differ from that composed by Allan Ramsay (1686-1757), although he used the same tune. His lyrics begin 'The lass of Peaty's Mill', and he is supposed to have written them whilst staying with Sir William Cunningham of Robertland.

The broadside was published by James Lindsay of King Street in Glasgow. It is not dated.
'Margaret Bell's Lament' is narrated by a woman who is being transported for the murder of her illegitimate child. There are many broadsides on this subject. Due to the social stigma attached to illegitimate motherhood, infanticide among deperate single mothers was more common in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries than it is today. The usual sentence for the crime was death, but in this case the petitioning of the people of Paisley persuaded the Crown to commute Margaret Bell's sentence to transportation. This suggests that the was a great deal of sympathy and understanding among ordinary people for the plight of such women.

In this ballad, McGorran laments his impending execution and the murderous misdeeds that have brought him to this point. He admits to having been roused to such heights of 'cruel jealousy' by his wife and her lover that he drew 'the fatal knife'. Such tales of repentence and pleas for forgiveness and salvation were popular amongst the broadside readership. Street literature relating to crime was by far the most popular and outsold all other broadside genres.

15044,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(88b),"Verse 1: 'We'll sing you a song, and it wont be long, / If you listen to what we say / It's about two girls you know very well / And they live straight over the way. / There cheeks are as red as a piece of white chalk, / And they wear a Grecian bend; There's no mistake about it, / They're the mashers of Ramsey's Pend.' This song was published by the Poet's Box, 224 Overgate, Dundee.
This ballad is a rather misogynistic satire on the two girls referred to in the title as 'The Mashers of Ramsey's Pend'. 'Masher' is an obsolescent expression for 'dandy', a word normally applied to men. The fact that 'masher' is applied here to two women seems to be additional, deliberate insult. The song presents the girls as grotesques with blue hair and red noses, 'covered in muck'. Even the description of them as the 'prettiest piece of potted head' is repellent: potted head is a traditional Scottish dish made from sheep's heads.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

'Nell Flaherty's Drake' is an anonymous Irish ballad from the nineteenth century. The drake of the title is believed to be a coded reference to Robert Emmet (1778-1803), who helped to plan and led an uprising against British rule in Dublin in 1803. The uprising went wrong after an explosion at an arms depot, and Emmet was captured and hanged for his part in the uprising and the assassination of the Lord Chief Justice. Nell Flaherty represents Emmet's fiance, Sarah Curran, (1782-1808). The author curses those (i.e. the British authorities) who killed Nell Flaherty's drake and urges the readers to keep up the fight. Irish Home Rule was a volatile subject in Britain in the nineteenth as well as the twentieth century, hence the coding in this song.

There is no indication on the broadside of where this song originates. The fact that it is held in a Scottish collection and that it refers to mountainous country might lead one to assume that it is a Scottish song, but this is not necessarily the case. Broadside ballads published in Scotland sometimes originated in the United States, reflecting increasing trans-Atlantic travel. Many more originated in Ireland, reflecting the large numbers of Irish immigrants to Lowland Scotland during the industrial revolution. Whatever its origins, this ballad's sentiments of native pride and evocative natural imagery would probably have guaranteed its popularity: these were common themes in broadside ballads.

The theme of this sheet is the triumph of love over adversity - highlighted by the heiress Mary Neil eloping with John McCann. This was technically abduction, as she was the property of her father, and so McCann was imprisoned. They try again and escape to Quebec, where Mary is almost drowned. Eventually, Mary's father relents and invites John back to be lord of the manor. This story, set in Ireland and on a romantic theme, would probably have appealed to the immigrant Irish population who had settled in Glasgow.

This broadside is a good testament to the fact that women kept public houses, and that it was accepted as normal in the society of the time. There are other broadsides held in the National Library of Scotland's collection, which refer to women making careers in public houses. This whole tale - Mary's son Dan tries to seduce her maid - is a common theme in broadsides. In this tale, unusually, each character receives a voice and the seduction is virtually endorsed as a result.

This broadside was published by James Lindsay of King Street in Glasgow. It does not carry a price or a date of publication.
'My Nannie's Awa'' is a simple example of the pathetic fallacy at work. This is a literary term used to explain a tendency in poets and authors to describe nature in terms of personal emotions. Examples in this song are the narrator's description of autumn as 'pensive' and winter as 'dreary', words which reflect his own emotions at the loss of his lover. 'Burns and his Highland Mary' is a romantic song based around Robert Burns's (1759-96) love affair with 'Highland' Mary Campbell (1763-86), which ended with her tragically early death. The authors of the two songs are not identified on the sheet.

There are many broadside ballads extant that were written in praise of Scotland's countryside, but this is more skilfully constructed than most. The poem draws parallels between the short lives of the flowers in Nether Mill Glen and the transience of human beauty, but compares the spring that runs through the glen to a fountain of eternal love that will keep a young couple happy all their lives if they drink from it.

The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?!

Part of this ballad takes the form of a dialogue between Margaret and the Minister. Upon arriving at the minister's house laden with gifts, Margaret is invited to stay for dinner. Anxious that she will show herself up in company, the minister finally persuades her to stay by suggesting she just follow his example at the dinner table. This kindly advice results in Margaret's humiliation, and the tale ends with her fleeing from the house. Whilst this humorous ballad would have proved entertaining for readers, it also offered a comment on the differences between the social classes - perhaps suggesting that never the twain should meet!

The first part of this ballad is extremely erudite, at is provides its audience with an epic pageant of female characters who are renowned for their beauty. The awe-struck narrator continues to employ famous female characters from history, myth and literature as he struggles to do justice to his beloved's beauty. After invoking all these goddesses and spirits, he then states that his treasure is well known throughout Inveraray.

This illustrates the broadside's role in conveying information. It is assumed that the audience will already be familiar with the background and so that information is pared down. Meanwhile, the rest of the space is given over to 'new information' which would be part of its sales appeal as well.
This style of text, with its implicit political propaganda, would not only have made for compelling entertainment, but would also perhaps have stimulated political thought, reasoning and debate.",Broadside ballad entitled 'My Big Wig All So Mealy and White',1830-1840

This sheet was published by James Lindsay of 11 King Street, Glasgow.
This ballad is a lament sung by a young man for his absent lover. Although the ballad highlights the many joys that nature can offer, it seems that the lovesick young man can no longer appreciate these joys, as he can only think about his departed lover. The advertisement at the bottom of this sheet is especially interesting, as it gives a good illustration of the diversity that a broadside publisher could offer the public. Many romantic broadside ballads such as this are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

As with many broadsides, there is no further information about this ballad included on the sheet. It is, however, quite decorative in comparison to most others held in the National Library of Scotland's collection. The image, a rather grim and stark figure, does not seem entirely appropriate to the topic and tone of the lyrics. Woodcuts, however, were expensive to create and so one generic image was often used across many sheets. It also made the sheet a more competitive and attractive purchase.

The top of the sheet carries a woodcut of a grand, classical-styled building, which is built over an archway. There are no publication details given, but this is one of two songs - printed by James Lindsay - on this sheet. 
It is made clear in the lyrics that the characters adhere to the Roman Catholic religion, and so this distinction may have been important to, and had a greater meaning for, readers at the time. The lyrics recount a classic broadside tale of two lovers parted by distance. It would seem that the girl's lover has been forced to travel and resettle in America, where she hopes he will prosper. She, in turn, will wear widow's weeds and live in the hope of his return.

It was published by Robert McIntosh of 96 King Street, Calton, Glasgow, and includes a rather crude woodcut illustration.
Although no date has been provided on this broadside, Robert McIntosh was registered at the above address in the 1849 Edinburgh Directory. It is, therefore, safe to assume that this broadside was published in the mid-nineteenth century. Although in most cases broadsides reported local crimes and events, news of particularly gruesome or notable crimes often travelled the length of the country. In this case a murder committed near Manchester has reached a Glasgow publisher.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day.

This sheet deals with a common broadside topic - a shrewish wife. The husband is still very much in love with his wife, Meg, but he makes it clear that she is a much changed person compared to her youthful self. He does not, however, mention his own behaviour over the years or in their present situation, although he does refer to having made it through some tough times.

There are other broadsides held in the National Library of Scotland's collection, which were written in praise of inn or tavern keepers. Most keepers are praised for their friendly manner and the quality of their beer. In this text, however, it is the location of Mungo's pub and the company he keeps which are highlighted. He appears to be a bachelor, who just keeps an open house. This seems to suit the other men in the area, as time well spent in a relaxing and convivial situation.

Broadsides were sold as the cheap entertainment of their day and even at that time were considered ephemera. This sheet would have been especially appealing as two songs could be bought for a penny, the usual cost, instead of one.

The text beneath the title reads: 'Wretten Composed and Sung by WILFORD TAYLOR, Comedian and Vocalist with emmense success, [Strictly Copyright,]'. The broadside was published by the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee.
As the second line suggests, this ballad is concerned with the 'topics of the day'. The author, Wilford Taylor, is clearly a man of humanitarian principles. He condemns a judge for imprisoning a man for begging for bread. He also criticises hardline Tory policy against Irish Home Rule campaigners. The song was probably written around 1886 when the seventh Earl of Aberdeen, John Campbell Gordon was briefly Lord Lieutenant or Viceroy of Ireland. He held the same position from 1906 to 1915.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

This ballad refers to the tragic story of Mrs McLeod, who was executed in Edinburgh in 1727, for the crime of forgery. It is not clear from the sheet who John Gibson actually was. However, his strenuous efforts to make Mrs McLeod confess and repent for her many sins suggest that he could be a minister, sent to 'the condemned cell' to make her see the light during her last hours.

The name of the publisher is not included and the sheet is not dated.
This very dark ballad is mainly narrated from the viewpoint of a wealthy young gentleman called William Corder, who murdered his sweetheart, Maria Marten. The ballad is based on a chilling crime that took place in Polstead, Suffolk, in May 1827. After a brief courtship, Corder told Marten that he wished to marry her, and visited her family's home to inform them about the arrangements for the ceremony. Instead of taking her to Ipswich, however, he took her to a part of his premises called the Red Barn and murdered her. After being found guilty by the jury, Corder then confessed to the crime. He was executed on the 11th of August, 1828. A broadsheet published in London by James Catnach about this crime sold over one million copies.

Not only is this song written in broad and colloquial Scots, but the typesetting is not all that accurate either, making parts of it virtually unintelligible. It also illustrates the speed with which most of these sheets were conceived, produced and sold. This sheet celebrates the excellent atmosphere which the well-rounded and socially-adept publican, Mungo McGill, creates in his ale-house. Although he is praised for his standards and skills, his ability to mix with everyone appears to make him seem peculiar to most people.

This curious piece of comedy theatre is more like an advert for Johnnie Dowie's alehouse. The fact that an entertaining poem is included, perhaps confused people into buying before they realised it was a marketing ploy. Ale-houses brewed their own beer at the time, so advertising the quality and taste of it was marketing angle. Libberton's Wynd was also where most of the hangings in Edinburgh occurred and so there was probably a lot of money to made if the public knew where you were.

A note before the song mentions it was 'Sung, with great applause, at the last dinner given by the Edinburgh Sour Milks'. James, sometimes referred to as 'Jemmy' or 'Jamie' Aytoun, (1797-1881) was the Radical Party candidate in the 1841  parliamentary elections. This piece accuses him of having Tory sympathies and directs bitter satire at him, accusing him of being hypocritical and corrupt.
The National Library of Scotland holds another broadside relating to this incident, entitled 'Aytoun the Yeoman!, or, The Orator Left in the Lurch by One of his Own Voters'.

The Mound in Edinburgh was created in 1769, after Nor' Loch had been drained six years earlier, by the rubble and back-fill from the new housing estate or the New Town. This building work had been ongoing for at least two years, when one of the engineers, Boyd, laid a temporary bridge across the gap to shorten the route between the two towns. The railway was eventually run underneath the Mound during the 1840s, and the National Gallery and Royal Institute were built here afterwards. This broadside probably relates to the controversy over the construction of the National Gallery. There was a widely-held view that the Mound was being ruined by the new buildings. The mention of a 'primrose' in the penultimate verse, may be a veiled reference to Mr. Bouverie Primrose, secretary of the Board of Manufactures who were responsible for financing the building of the Gallery.
The fact that the real point of this poem is difficult to understand for modern readers, and that there is no contextual information included for the reader's benefit, illustrates the broadside's function in society.

'My Ain Fireside' may be intended to share the same melody as the celebrated song of the same name by Elizabeth Hamilton (1758-1816), but the subject matter of this song is far earthier. Hamilton's 'My Ain Fireside' celebrates humilty economy and sobriety, themes taken further in her didactic novel, The Cottagers of Glenburnie' (1808). By contrast, the song on this broadside advocates enjoying a drink, or several drinks, as long as they are not taken at the expense of a happy home life.

This ballad, although light-hearted, demonises the drinking of alcohol - particularly the excesses of the New Year. The last line calls out for intemperance to be banished 'far from our shore'. The Temperance Movement was a phenomenon that first appeared in the nineteenth century. Supporters of the movement, believing that alcohol was responsible for a great many of the social ills of the day, strongly advocated abstinence from alcohol.

A popular song, this would have already been known to a large section of the broadside-buying public. This version, however, was to be sung to a new tune. With no musical notation supplied, people relied on the chapmen and patterers who were selling the broadsides to sing the ballads as they wandered through the streets. This enabled people to familiarise themselves with the melody and also, in a society where literacy was by no means universal, memorise the words.

This comic ballad relies on the stereotype of fishwives being terrible gossips. In the first verse the narrator pretends to be shy, but from the start of the second verse she recounts her life story in minute detail, digressing wildly and even returning after the dance interlude to add three more 'encore' verses. The way the sheet is laid out, with the dance and encores clearly marked, confirms that this ballad was very much intended for public performance.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box.

The name 'Whig', given to the 'Country Party', was taken from a group of non-Conformist Scottish outlaws, the 'Whiggamores'. This non-conformity and rebellion suited the party's aims at the time. The Whigs, by and large, were anti-Catholic and anti-Monarchy. They were often staunch puritans and they campaigned for parliamentary powers to outweigh those of the monarchy. This laissez-faire and more democratic attitude, however, eventually won them more support in the growing industrial centres.
This style of text, with its implicit political propaganda, would not only have made for compelling entertainment, but would also perhaps have stimulated political thought, reasoning and debate.",Broadside ballad entitled 'A New Whig Garland',1830-1840

The narrator of this ballad appears to be someone who has been exiled for supporting a Jacobite rising. It is more likely that the ballad refers to the 1715 rising in support of James Stewart, 'The Old Pretender', than the 1745 rising of 'Bonnie Prince' Charles Edward Stewart. Despite the ballad's Jacobite sympathies, verse eight praises the Hanoverian King George, probably to prevent the printer being accused of treason. However, a later hand has changed 'George' to 'James'.

Narrated by a young woman, this romantic ballad tells the story of her love for a 'Bonny Highland Laddie'. The narrator describes the clothes her beloved wears, and mentions how she would love to wrap him up in her plaid. Following this, she defiantly states how his lowly rank is of no consequence to her, such is the degree of her love for him. The young woman concludes her ballad by announcing that, once they had arrived in Stirling for their marriage, her 'tocher' (a woman's dowry) consisted of being lovingly embraced up by him in his own Highland plaid.

This broadside was published by John Reid of Pearson's Close in Edinburgh, in 1719.
'The New Way of Bonny Jean' is a ballad whose events and meaning are shrouded in classical allusion and metaphor. The verses seem to chart the seduction of a young girl, Jean. At the start, Jean is depicted in an Edenic situation by a river, clad in laurel and at one with nature. After being pierced with Cupid's arrow, however, 'She leaves the Grove to follow Love'. The final verse implies that Jean has suffered a fall from grace, and now inhabits a place 'where soft perfuming flames do burn'.

This broadside tells the familiar story of a virtuous but warm girl, Jane, who was tricked in love by the wealthy blade, John. Unfortunately, she died trying to give birth to their illegitimate child. It has become clear from marriage and baptismal entries that it was normal for couples to live together upon betrothal. It has also become clear from cemetery excavations that between a quarter and half of the female population, before the introduction of modern hospitals, died in childbirth.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

This ballad appears to revolve around the reception Queen Victoria received upon her arrival in Edinburgh, during her 1842 tour of Scotland. Although the Lord Provost, James Forrest, was meant to lead a welcoming party to greet the sovereign, there was some confusion over the date of her arrival and they failed to make an appearance. In this 'New Song' the rather unfortunate incident is blamed on the actions of the then Prime Minister, Robert Peel (1788-1850). The ballad goes on to attack some of the reforms that were introduced by Peel during his time as home secretary and prime minister.
The song is a parody of the traditional Jacobite ballad 'Up and Warn A', Wullie', which, according to Robert Burns, was the warning of a Highland clan to arms. It was referred to by Lowlanders as 'Up and Waur Them A', Willie', and in this version has been changed to 'Up an' rin awa' Robie'.",Broadside ballad entitled 'A New Song to an Old Tune',1842-

Queen Victoria paid her first visit to Scotland in 1842 after the precedent was set by George IV in 1822. She was officially welcomed to her Northern Kingdom in Edinburgh, although the procession did not go entirely smoothly here. Stands collapsed, there was a dangerous security mix-up and one of Scotland's earls was run over by her carriage! These incidents, however, already added to the already prolific volume of material written in her honour - such as this anonymous poem.

The song was to be sung to the tune 'Up, an' Waur Them A', Willie'. The broadside was priced at one penny. It does not carry the name of the publisher or the place of publication.
This ballad refers to Queen Victoria's (reign: 1838-1901) first tour of Scotland, in 1842. The narrator criticises her advisers, The Duke of Buccleuch and Robert Peel, the prime minster, for hurrying the Queen off to Edinburgh instead of encouraging her to stop and greet the crowds that had turned out for her arrival at Granton Pier. The narrator also mocks Edinburgh's Lord Provost, James Forrest, who missed the queen's entrance altogether. This incident became the subject of its own satirical ballad, 'Jemmie Forrest'. Despite the inauspicious start, Victoria's tour turned out a success, amd thereafter she became the monarch who re-established strong royal connections with Scotland.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day. Cheaply available, they were sold on the streets by pedlars and chapmen.

In medieval Scotland, a 'Gaberlunyman', more commonly 'Gaberlunzie Man', was a licensed beggar and beadsman, who would pray for the souls of others for a fee. The word 'gaberlunzie' is believed to have come from the French words 'gaban', referring to a sleeved, hooded cloak, and 'laine', meaning 'wool'. The cloaks these men wore were blue, so they were also known as 'bluegowns'. This song probably predates another song about the 'Gaberlunzie Man' in Allan Ramsay's 'Tea-Table Miscellany' of Scots songs, which was first published in 1724.

It is relatively unusual to find an author's name attached to a broadside as most of the sheets remained anonymous. This was a trade-off as it was cheap and quick to have work published this way. It was likely that John Wilson was the compiler of 'The songs of Scotland' published in the early 1840s. He is the subject of another song of this site 'Scotia's dirge' which laments his death in 'America' (probably QuebecCity ) in 1849. Wilson was best known as a tenor, successful in Covent Garden and Drury Lane, London and throughout the eastern seaboard of North America.

The nineteenth century was a time of great social and political reform. Amongst other things, every working-class male householder received the vote (1867 Reform Act) and measures were put in place to tackle issues such as poor health, poverty, education and working conditions. This song light-heartedly pokes fun at the notion of 'reform fever'. 'For to Reform Lord Derby's bill', in the final verse, possibly refers to a bill that was introduced by Lord Derby in 1830s to abolish slavery.

Although the words are written down on this sheet implying they would be read, many more, mainly illiterate, people would have had access to the information carried here. This was due to the public and group-based nature of broadside entertainment. As a result this song still exhibits features of the oral tradition, such as short verses and an easy repetitive chorus, so that it can be easily remembered.

A note below the title states that the ballad should be sung to the traditional tune, 'The Young Lochinvar'. Although there are no publication details included on this sheet, the reference to Jamie Aytoun suggests that it was most likely published in Edinburgh during the 1830s.
Illustrated with a woodcut that contains Joan of Arc's famous motto, 'Without fear and without reproach', this political ballad refers to an electoral contest in Edinburgh between James Aytoun (1797-1881) and Sir John Campbell. Written in the mock-heroic style of a battle between two knights, the writer certainly appears to favour Campbell over Aytoun. While it is known that Aytoun was a well known member of the Radical Party in Edinburgh in the 1830s and 40s, there is less information about who Campbell was - though he might well have been a candidate for the Whig Party. The National Library of Scotland's collection contains many broadsides that report on political contests in Edinburgh during this period.

This ballad addresses the common theme of innocence deceived, through the story of Jane and John. John, the rakish, moneyed blade, meets with the good and virtuous Jane in Glasgow, whereupon he persuades her into a relationship with him. He eventually drops her, but her despair is heightened by the knowledge of her pregnancy. The broadside ends on the practical, if not necessarily appropriate, scene of the girl's death in childbirth, the comment being that she no longer has to live in sin, while John, oblivious to the misery he caused, continues with his life.

During the years of industrialisation, emigration from Ireland to Scotland reached record levels as the Irish travelled in search of work. At the same time, broadside producers became aware of the arrival of this new audience and began producing sheets that would appeal to them. This included news reports from Ireland and ballads recalling the beauty of Erin and the bravery of the Irish. Unfortunately, it also led to broadsides that played on the fears and prejudices of people who, in their ignorance, were afraid and suspicious of these new arrivals.

This light-hearted song bewails the rising prices that are one consequence of the war. As with many broadsides, this one assumes a certain degree of knowledge amongst the readership and, as such, does not actually name the war in question. Although this can at times be confusing for the modern-day reader, it would have made sense to a contemporary audience. After lamenting these 'Dear Times', the author makes his own plea: 'Now, to conclude, and make an end / Unto my humble lines. / You know with us poor singers / It is very hard times. / But to live, and let live, / Is a maxim you all know, / So I hope you'll buy a song from me, / Before that you do go'.

The tune 'Welcome Royal Charlie' was a well-known Jacobite tune, although its author and date are obscured by the anonymity which most Jacobite supporters adopted to protect themselves. It did, however, enjoy more publishing popularity in England and Ireland, especially, than in Scotland.
The references to Macaulay, Lyon and Nick, in the lyrics, are now a little obscure, although the whole piece seems to refer to some sort of support or vote. The reference to 'Reikie' would suggest that it is set in Edinburgh, taken from the nickname 'Auld Reekie'.",Broadside ballad entitled 'New Song',1830-1840

This ballad is sung to the tune of 'Lochaber no more', and there is a generic woodcut scene of hunting at the top of the page.
The tune to this piece is believed to have been based on the Irish air, 'Limerick's Lamentation'. The majority of scholars believe the original was adapted by the Irish harpist, Thomas Connellan (1640-1698) although it has recently been suggested that Myles O'Reilly (b. 1635), another Irish harpist, may have made these changes. The lyrics were written by Allan Ramsay (1686-1757), and although he was not a declared Jacobite supporter, they do reveal his Jacobite sympathies.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century.

Very little is known about Mr Ramondon, Senior, except that he was a prolific broadside lyricist. 'Celia' was a popular pastoral literary motif, during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. There was a resurgence in interest in the classical period and in retelling simple romances, during this period. The name 'Celia' appealed as it fulfilled both functions, stemming from the Latin Caelius which had connotations of heaven. Its use was lost during the Middle Ages, but it was rediscovered and then pioneered by Shakespeare in his play, 'As You Like It'.

This broadside is not dated and does not carry the name of the publisher or the place of publication.
'The new police' probably refers to the municipal police forces that began to be established in Great Britain in the 1830s. Robert Peel's Metropolitan Police Act of 1829 set up the first modern police force, in London, and the Municipal Corporations Act of 1835 extended the provision for similar forces to be set up across the country. The new police was not universally popular, and the satirical poem on this broadside suggests that the force attracted corrupt and violent men, and that it was designed to spoil the enjoyment and leisure of ordinary people.

As the title suggests, this is a song composed of lines and images from various famous Scots songs. Several of the source songs are by Robert Burns, including  'Of a' the airts', Ca' the yowes', 'My love is like a red red rose' and 'Ye banks and braes of bonnie Doon'.

Although no publisher is named, the sheet was printed in 1724.
With its allusions to the bible and classical myths, this panegyric humorously employs lofty similes to create a mock-epic dedicated to a man named Robert Cowan. Despite the content provided in the sheet's introduction, unfortunately, the broadside does not offer very much information regarding the fine details behind the situation. However, it appears that Cowan was involved in the shipping trade, and had defrauded his creditors - hence the poem's references to smugglers and pirates. The author appears to draw a parallel between a perilous ocean voyage and Cowan's hazardous trip to the Tron to face his creditors. The ominous mentioning of Captain John Dalgleish, meanwhile, is a darkly humorous reference to the famous Edinburgh lock-man and hangman.

A woodcut illustration of a man carrying two guns has been included at the top of the sheet. Standing next to him is a dog or some other type of animal. Sometimes used in a derogatory way, 'Paddy' is a familiar form of the name Patrick or an informal name for an Irishman.
Interestingly, but possibly unintentionally, this ballad changes from third to first person halfway through the railway journey. 'Paddy' suddenly takes over the narrative himself and explains the events following the train ride. Although he talks of working through the harvest after arriving in Glasgow, there is also mention of him returning home to Ireland. Paddy's travels in search of work were probably fairly typical of the thousands of migrant workers who travelled from Ireland to Scotland in search of employment, particularly during the nineteenth century.

'Old Zipcoon' or 'Old Zip Coon' seems to have been a name which was used for any tune to which an 'Old Zip Coon' quadrille could be danced. As a result of its generic name, tunes which fitted this timing were probably quite widely and well known. The chorus to this song uses the phrase 'Arrah cushla', which was a popular tag line amongst broadsides. This would have made it easier to remember the song and shows how many ideas were 'shared' amongst authors.

As the Industrial Revolution's success took on a life of its own, it brought with it, for the workers, poverty and the danger of industrial injuries and deaths. There was also a move during the nineteenth century towards expressing Christian piety and British superiority through charity.

Below the title we are told that 'Copies can always be had at the Poet's Box, 192 OVERGATE, DUNDEE'. 'Shoon' means 'shoes'.
This light-hearted ballad tells of a family's humorous concern regarding the tomboyish behaviour of their wee lassie, Kate. The ballad provides the reader with a litany of her mischievous scrapes, though the writer concedes that Kate is just full of life rather than an ill-behaved child. In short, the ballad is a celebration of the joys and tribulations that a lively young girl can bring to a family. Many broadside ballads such as this one are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills.

The ballad uses a slightly comic style to tell what is really quite a serious tale. In this song an expectant father is drinking with his friends when he is told his wife has gone into labour, and it is an 'unco fat bairn'. He runs home and realises he must fetch the midwife or his wife will die. It is never revealed whether mother and child survive the ordeal.

James Lindsay had one of the biggest printers in Glasgow, and his business ran for over 50 years, at various addresses. He was at King Street between 1860 and 1894. The Glasgow Directory for 1847 also has him registered as a 'Paper and Rag Merchant, Rope and Twine Manufacturer'. With fierce competition from other firms, printers and publishers often diversified.

This humorous conversation between a man, who is questioning how his wages are spent, and his wife, who explains it in full, is rather entertaining. It must have been amusing for the audience. It remains today as an illuminating list of household goods and maintenance and their expenses. It also reinforces, both for contemporary readers and those today, that a wife's role at the time, was in the home, while her husband was the working breadwinner. A further enlightening glimpse of women's education is also provided, as the wife is praised for good housekeeping and can reckon more than adequately.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The one pound two',1840-1850

The text preceding it reads: ' An excellent and proper New Ballad, Entituled, / OLD LONG SYNE / Newly corrected and amended, with a large and new / Edition of several excellent Love Lines. / To be sung with its own proper Musical Sweet Tune.'
There have been a variety of airs and lyrics published under the name 'Old Long Syne' or 'Auld Lang Syne'. Debate rages over whether the first tune originated in England, but no firm conclusions have been drawn. There are various versions of the words, the most famous being those composed by Allan Ramsay (1686-1757) and Robert Burns (1759-1796). These versions, however, are both different to this copy. These lyrics were copied across many broadsides and were eventually formally printed by James Watson in 1711.

It was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow, and probably sold for one penny.
A woodcut illustration has been included of a well-dressed woman sitting on an armchair, with a younger woman at her side. This would have added to the appeal of this particular sheet, and probably helped sales.
The armchair in this ballad replaces the sweetheart as an object of affection. Whilst the owner of the armchair laments the death of his or her mother whilst sitting in the chair, an undying and desperate love for the chair is declared: 'But I love it, I love it, and cannot tear / My soul from loving that old arm chair'. By choosing to idolise an old armchair, the author parodies the traditional themes of tragic and unrequited love found in so many ballads.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The Old Arm Chair',1852-1859

The broadside was priced at one penny and published by James Kay of Glasgow.
'O'Donnell Abu!' is a song about the wars between Protestant Elizabethan troops and Ireland's native and Catholic clans, led by Hugh O'Donnell, in the 1590s. The tune for O'Donnell Abu was composed in the early part of the 19th century by Joseph Haliday, a man from Carrick-on-Suir, Co. Tipperary. He was bandmaster of the Cavan militia. Michael McCann, a young Galway man, added words to the music. The composition first appeared  in 'The Nation' of January, 1843 and was then called 'The Clan Connell War Song'. 'Jamie Raeburn' is a traditional song about a young Glasgow baker reputedly falsely convicted of theft, and transported. The song is still performed today by the Scottish folk group the 'Tannahill Weavers'.

A woman stands to one side and a windmill is visible in the background.
At a time when married women generally stayed at home and 'kept house', it was common practice for the woman of the house to be handed a portion of her husband's weekly wages for the housekeeping. In this light-hearted ballad, Maggy's husband questions her over the spending of his wages. He appears to believe the idle chit-chat of neighbours and accuses her of misspending it. What follows is a complete breakdown of the weekly expenditure, and his humble apologies for doubting her.

This piece appears to have been written specially to announce the arrival in Edinburgh of the Irish politician and rebel Daniel O'Connell (1775-1847). O'Connell was a campaigner for Catholic Emancipation and the Repeal of the Irish Union with Great Britain, subjects which would have struck a chord with many Scots.

As with many traditional folk songs, there are a number of different versions of this ballad in existence, including one featured in Volume IV of the 'Scots Musical Museum' (1792), under the title 'Hey, how my Johnie Lad'. It begins: 'Hey, how my Johnie lad, / ye're no sae kind's ye sud hae been / Gin your voice I had na kent, / I cou'd na eithly trow my een.'

Queen Anne (1702-1714) had signed the Act of Settlement in 1701, which angered Scotland as it approved the succession of the House of Hanover and not the original Stuart line. To end the dispute, the Parliaments were unified in 1707. The bickering continued however, with the Tories supporting the Stuarts and the Whigs the Hanoverians. In 1711 the Whig majority could not reach an agreement with the Tories and so Anne was forced into creating peers for political purposes. This not only weakened the royal prerogative but caused a little unrest, as expressed here.

John Home's (1722-1808) tragic play, 'Douglas', was based on this ballad. It tells the story of the infant son of Douglas, who is supposed dead by his parents. Old Norval, a shepherd, finds and brings up the boy, who saves his stepfather, Lord Randolph's, life and is then reunited with his mother. Randolph's heir, Glenalvon, however, is not happy about having his inheritance threatened and puts an end to Young Norval's life. In despair, Lady Randolph throws herself from a cliff.

There is a town and a hill in the background of the image.
This altercation between a reluctant English maid and Scots man is given very little context other than their interaction. The maid eventually escapes from the man across the river, taking some of his money with her. The woodcut at the top would have increased the sheet's perceived value.

The composer of this ballad, John Young, combined his writing with publishing and working as a Professor of Poetry in St Andrews - presumably at the university. Seemingly written in March 1852, the ballad aims to win our sympathy for poor Nancy Young, who has been abandoned by the husband that she loves so much. The tone of the ballad (as reflected in the song's imagery) is very much one of abandonment and hopelessness, with Nancy seeking the bliss of death. Interestingly, an emotional footnote at the bottom of the sheet reveals that the ballad is dedicated to 'all the Friends of the Poor'.

This song tells the tragic tale of homeless Mary and her child, who seek refuge at her father's house. Because of the noise of the wind howling outside he does not hear her shouts and Mary and her child freeze on the doorstep. Mary dies overnight, although the child survived for a short time, but 'to its mother went soon'.

Set in Tennessee, this rather unusual broadside tells its audience about the deaths of a father and his daughter. Interestingly, however, the father in this story seems to have been a black man, which is unusual for a broadside published in Scotland. The emphasis placed on the word 'free' is interesting, and could be interpreted as a comment that Old Jeff was a slave while living in Tennessee. The grieving tone of the ballad is highlighted by the mourning narrator's desire to find shelter underneath a weeping willow - a tree has been associated with sorrow and bereavement since ancient times.

This ballad appears to be a slightly tongue-in-cheek celebration of the potato. The author visualises a nation rejoicing and eating better than it ever has before, because there has been a good potato harvest. The roots of this humorous song are very serious, however. In 1842 a blight began to take hold of potato crops in North America, and by 1845 it had spread to the British Isles. In areas such as Ireland, and the Scottish Highlands, where the livelihood and diet of people were heavily dependent on potatoes, the effects of successive crop failures were devasting, causing many deaths and increased emigration. There were also failures of the potato harvest in Britain and Ireland in the 1870s.

There are a number of other broadsides contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection that deal with the same issues as the 'Poor Irish Stranger'. The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries found thousands of Irish people leaving their homeland, to escape oppressive agricultural policies and the resulting threat of starvation. Many moved to Scotland hoping to find work in the rapidly growing industrial centres. This ballad would have struck a chord with all those who desperately longed for the shores of Ireland.

Ballads warning of the dangers of drink were quite commonly found on broadsides, especially in the later nineteenth century when the Temperance Movement had begun to gather momentum across Britain. One of the most persuasive arguments against drunkenness was the effect alcoholism had on children and family life, and the use of a pitiful 'drunkard's child' as narrator of a ballad, as in this case, was an effective way of appealing to the listener's conscience. Another broadside ballad, called 'The Drunkard's Raggit Wean', seems to have provoked a particularly strong reaction, as it was frequently reprinted and inspired several ballads responding to it.

This ballad is narrated by a former soldier who is starving after having been discharged out from the army without a pension. Until 1871 British soldiers were not entitled to retirement pensions and only those who left the army with a disabling injury received pensions. It is possible that this ballad was symptomatic of a wider discontent about this situation, as it was almost certainly written near to the time the rule on pensions was changed: references to fighting in India date the ballad to after 1857-58, when British forces suppressed the first Indian War of Independence, also known as the Indian Mutiny.

There are other broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection which carry various versions of the lyrics to 'Old Long Syne'.

'Agee' in this instance means 'crooked'. A woodcut illustration of a carriage pulled by a team of horses decorates the top of this sheet.
This ballad takes the form of an open attack against the Tories and the candidate chosen to represent them in an upcoming election. The candidate in question was the renowned Edinburgh merchant, John Learmonth. Owner of the Dean Estate and Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1832), Learmonth stood for parliament as the Tory candidate for Edinburgh in the mid-nineteenth century. He is perhaps best remembered for funding the construction of the Dean Bridge in 1831. In fact, in the fourth verse of this ballad, his nose is disparagingly compared to his beloved bridge: 'And then see its bridge! What a terrible height! / So towering! fleshless! and lean! / Just almost as high, altho' not perhaps quite, / As its counterpart over the Dean!'

Although a lot of contextual information has been included here, unfortunately without a date and location, it is still a little difficult to place the author and his ballad into its historical background.

Through employing epic similes from classical mythology, this melancholic poem commemorates in lofty style the bravery of two soldiers. Frustratingly, the broadside offers little information regarding the identities of these men or the situation that caused their deaths, so it is difficult to place the poem in its proper historical context. However, the reference near the end of the poem to a 'brat' being born in Rome is quite likely a reference to the birth of Charles Edward Stuart, or 'Bonnie Prince Charlie' (1720-88). The mention of fighting 'upon our Street' and the 'cairn' which marks the spot where both men fell, also suggests that this is a song lamenting the soldiers who died during this bloody civil war.

This is a delicious piece of gossip and satire. Each line offers an opinion on different members of the Scots nobility of the time, and they are not always complimentary. All those mentioned are male. There are some allusions to contemporary politics, for instance, the Jacobites, but in the main it is the nobles' characters which are the focus.

A note below the title states that the ballad should be sung to the tune, 'Buxom Joan of Deptford'. Although there are no publication details included on this sheet, the reference to Francis Jeffrey suggests that it was almost certainly published in Edinburgh during the 1830s.
Written towards the end of the great 'Age of Party', this broadside pours scorn on an Edinburgh politician called 'Piper John'. Unfortunately, however, the ephemeral nature of broadsides means that it is very difficult to positively identify all of the political personalities who are mentioned in the ballad. In turn, this makes it hard to place the sheet in its proper historical context. However, the Jeffrey referred to in verse six is certainly Lord Francis Jeffrey (1773-1850), founder of 'The Edinburgh Review?.  Moving away from the people named in the ballad, the writer reveals much about electoral contests in Edinburgh during the 1830s.

Tonny Ashton is described in a handwritten annotation on this ballad as 'master of a playhouse in Edr'. Tony, or Tonny,  Aston or Ashton, was a strolling player who came to Edinburgh in the 1720s. He was promoted by the poet Allan Ramsay who wrote prologues for Aston?s performances as well as selling tickets for his plays. In 1726 Aston was denied a licence to perform by the Master of the Revels as he had failed to pay to the Revels office, the dues he owed them. Nevertheless he continued to perform until Skinner?s Hall (where he performed) was shut down. After a spell of litigation, Aston cut his losses and left Edinburgh in 1728. The fact that Ashton was English seems also to count against him.

This ballad condemns a newspaper writer or publisher, Sir Peter Curlew, who has been repeatedly attacking or mocking members of the Free Church in print. Curlew is accused of 'dealing in scandal', a criticism that is still frequently levelled at the press in Britain. The author of 'Peter's Picture for a Bawbee' was Alexander Rodger (1784-1846), a native of Midlothian who gave up an apprenticeship as a handloom weaver to work on a Glasgow newspaper, named 'The Sprit of the Union', in 1819. The newspaper was suppressed for sedition, but Rodger found employment writing for the 'Reformers Gazette'. Rodger is best remembered for songs and poems that were political in tone but retained a sense of humour.

The text above the title reads, 'An Excellent new Song lately composed'.
Although the ballad was to be sung 'To its own proper New Tune', no musical notation has been provided. This was not unusual, as many of the songs and melodies that featured on broadsides were already well-known amongst the populace and, therefore, such information was unnecessary. Also, at a time when few people could read, even fewer could interpret musical scores. Most people familiarised themselves with songs and melodies by carefully listening.

In other versions of this ballad Pat McGuire appears as Pat Maguire, and Mary Caze is referred to as Mary Kays or Mary Keys.
Pat McGuire calls on the nine Muses of Greek mythology to assist him in telling his tale. Wrongly accused of a crime he did not commit by 'Mary Caze', as revenge for refusing to marry her, McGuire ends up thrown in Lifford Jail. The truth does out, however, and McGuire is soon set free to pursue his ambition of serving the Church of Rome. The ballad of Pat McGuire appears on another broadside contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection, along with an illustrative woodcut and publishing details.

The chorus reads: 'I was never fond of telling lies, / My name is Pat M'Salday, / He was afraid of our Irish boys, / Was General Garibaldi.'
This ballad pokes fun at the Italian general and political leader, Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-82). Despite Garibaldi's status as a revolutionary hero, Pat McSalday is far from impressed by this leading light from the campaign for Italian unificiation. During 1862 and 1867, Garibaldi led two unsuccessful campaigns to liberate Rome from papal rule. In response to these efforts, many impassioned Irishmen travelled to Europe to fight in defence of papal power. Their reaction to Garibaldi's endeavours possibly explains the disparaging tone of this ballad.

This ballad recounts the misfortunes, both in love and money, of this wandering pedlar who is eventually left bankrupt and with a drinking habit. He is then forced to 'take the king's shilling' and join the British Army to survive. The mention of General Picton suggests that the pedlar was posted to Madras in the 1790s, as this was one of General Picton's famous strategic decisions.

In England, through Alexander Pope and Ambrose Philips, and in Scotland through Allan Ramsay, the eighteenth century saw a revival of the popularity of pastoral poetry, largely inspired by the Eclogues of Virgil. An eclogue is a short pastoral dialogue in verse. Ramsay in particular was skilled in the form, and achieved huge success with his pastoral play, 'The Gentle Shepherd', based on two of his earlier love eclogues. The poem on the broadside is a humorous parody of pastoral coventions, substituting the customary praise of nature with a melodramatic exchange about the death of a sheep.

It was to be sung to the tune 'The Sailor's Grave'. The broadside was priced at one penny and published on Saturday, 2nd May 1863. The publisher was the Poet's Box (probably Glasgow), but the town of publication has been obscured.
The word 'parody' in the title of this ballad suggests that it may be a satire on the words of an earlier song to the same melody. Anti-Irish sentiments are suggested by details like the 'murphies' or potatoes that are buried in 'Paddy's Grave' with the dead Irishman. Such sentiments were commonplace in the nineteenth century, with the Irish home rule struggle continuing and Irish migrants to industrial areas of Britain encountering suspicion and prejudice. This 'Sailor's Grave' is no relation to the later popular song by Arthur Sullivan (1842-1900) and H.F. Lyte.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

15835,ballad,L.C.1270(002),"As this broadside contains two separate ballads, the chapmen would have sold the sheet as a special offer of two for the price of one. The opening line of the first ballad reads: 'O whar hae you been a' day, creeshie soutar Johnnie'. The opening line of the second ballad reads: 'All in the Downs the fleet was moor'd'. 'Cresshie' means 'greasy'.
The first ballad on this broadside is a drinking song. However, this drinking song contains a moral message, since the lyrics instruct 'soutar Johnnie' that he should be looking after his hungry children instead of spending his money on alcohol. The second ballad tells of a tearful young woman called Susan, who boards a British warship in search of her departing sweetheart, a sailor named William. As the ship is about to sail, William must quickly convince Susan of his love for her. He imaginatively achieves this aim by employing a number of poetic images in a poignantly romantic manner.

A 'pat' translates as a 'pot' in English. 'Brae' normally means 'hill', as this is a nonsense song it could possibly be meant as a joke. It was published by the Poet's Box of Dundee and sold for a penny.
This is a parody of Sir Walter Scott's 1816 poem, 'MacGregor's Gathering'. Scott's famous lines, 'While there's leaves in the forest / And foam on the river, / MacGregor, despite them, / Shall flourish forever!' have been altered in this version to, 'While there's leaves in a tammy book / Want we will never / Hurroo for Scotch Haddies / An parritch for ever.' A 'tammy book' is an account book held by a shop, and the lyrics imply that while you could get credit you would never go without haddock (haddies) or porridge (parritch).
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s.

It was to be sung to the tune of 'A Cobler there was'. The broadside was published by R. Morison of Perth and is not priced or dated.
'The Riot' probably dates from the first haf of the nineteenth century, when there was frequent civil unrest over Corn Laws. The first Corn Law of 1804 imposed a duty on imported foreign grain, in order to encourage sales of British grain, and the Corn Law of 1815 stated that this duty would only be suspended when British grain reached a price of 80 shillings per quarter. After a poor harvest in 1816, there were food riots across Britain, and protests continued until the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. This ballad offers both sides of the argument, but ultimately seems to advise that rioting is pointless, and that the government can not be blamed for poor harvests and bad weather.

This ballad was written by Alvan Marlaw, 'Apologizing to the shade of Coleridge'. It was printed by Lowden Macartney at the Poet's Box in Overgate, Dundee, priced one penny.
Alvan Marlaw's satirical ballad is a parody of Coleridge's 'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner' that delivers an indictment of corruption in civic and national government. Civic power is represented by the wealthy, selfish provost; the ancient harridan who stops him represents the State. The premise of the poem is that the ruling classes in Britain pay higher taxes, or bribes, in order to maintain the system of class and privilege, and ensure that the working classes remain poor and discriminated against in law. Radical ballads like this were quite common, especially in the nineteenth century.

Many broadside producers included an illustration to boost sales: the broadside-buying public were more inclined to buy a sheet that featured a picture, believing it to be better value for money. As a result, broadside publishers often kept a fairly limited stock of woodcuts and reused them. This often resulted in the illustration bearing little or no relation to the topic. Indeed, Powis Castle in Wales has little to do with the story of the reformed drunkard told in this ballad.

This ballad celebrates the British Navy's achievements in war at sea, and highlights especially those achieved under Horatio Nelson (1758-1805). Nelson commanded the Navy throughout the French Revolutionary War and in the early stages of the Napoleonic War. The 'Red, White and Blue' refers to the British flag, the Union Jack.

The name of the author has been included: 'J. Williams, Formerly of the Band XL Regt.'
This light-hearted song recounts the very long and special relationship that has developed between Jim Williams and his 'E flat Saxhorn'. They appear to have shared the best of times, 'When together we shared in the honour and praise', and the worst of times, 'I have one solace left me, this true friend of mine'. Although the notion of a special bond existing between a man and a musical instrument is a humorous one, the sentiments found in Williams' 'Recitation' are surprisingly touching.

The ballad 'Chevy Chase' was first registered at the Stationers' Hall in 1624 and is believed to have been about the Battle of Otterburn. This battle, in 1388, was one of the largest Scottish raids into England ever mounted by the Scots and it was left up to Henry 'Hotspur' Percy of Northumberland to exact revenge. The tune to the song, however, was regularly used to accompany folk ballads. This author has gone one step further by using many of the original words to the song but altering others to make it relevant to the case of Burke and Hare.
Burke and Hare were Irish bodysnatchers and murderers, who worked around Edinburgh's Canongate area - eventually becoming local legends. They hit upon the idea of murdering vulnerable or solitary people (in an attempt not to get caught) so that they could sell the bodies for dissection. Hare turned King's Evidence and so was acquitted, but this secured the conviction of Burke, who was hanged on the 28th January 1829.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The Recent Murders',1829

Most officer ranks in the army, during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, were filled by men who bought the position, mainly because of the status and security it bestowed. When these positions were vacated by death in service, however, there was no time for the position to undergo this process and so the next man, in order of seniority, won it. As a result, those without a lot of money volunteered - were not paid the King's shilling - as soldiers, and so were allowed to mess with the officers. Many were lost early in their careers, as these volunteers exhibited great daring in the hope of being noticed for promotion. During the Napoleonic Wars (1769-1820), especially, there was a high turnover of officers and so volunteer gentlemen did very well.

With its pageant-like references to a number of military commanders of the time, this ballad celebrates the martial glories of Great Britain, against the Catholic countries of France and Spain. These military references, combined with the toast to the Queen, suggest that the ballad was published during the reign of Queen Anne, from 1702 to 1714. Sounding the trumpet to herald a number of British victories, the eulogy closes with a joint toast to the Queen and the Duke of Marlborough (1650-1722). The recurring reference to Marlborough's valour, probably refers to his great victory over the French at the Battle of Blenheim, in 1704.

The broadside was published by Robert McIntosh. The date and place of publication are not given, but it is likely that this was the Robert McIntosh who operated from King Street, Glasgow, in the mid-nineteenth century.
This ballad concerns the many adventures of a man from County Clare in Ireland, and is narrated by himself. After knowing many women, joining the army, being imprisoned and then being broken free, the Rambler emigrates to America. The latter part of his story has a strong basis in fact. Both Ireland and the Scottish Highlands suffered from rural poverty and British government repression in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and this led to high levels of emigration. Many Irishmen also moved to Lowland Scotland as industrial workers and seasonal agricultural labourers, and this partly explains the large number of Irish songs which appear on broadsides in Scotland.

The institution of marriage is lampooned in this piece. The author bemoans the loss of the 'mad Frolicks' of his past, and speaks fondly of his batchelor days, which apparently were spent womanising and drinking. Now, he says, 'I us'd to top a Bottle or two, / But now drink small Beer with my Spouse'. He has been fettered by the chains of marriage he feels like 'like a Fox that is hamper'd . . . forc'd to creep in to my Hole'.

This broadside almost certainly refers to a visit to Scotland by Queen Victoria (1819-1901). The Queen was a frequent visitor to Scotland and, after her visit with her husband, Prince Albert, in 1842, she returned annually. In 1852 the couple bought land in Balmoral, Deeside, and had the famous castle built. Indeed, 'Balmorality' has since entered the lexicon as a Victorian type of morality. Queen Victoria wrote about the Scottish countryside in her memoirs, and her fondness for tartan helped the clothing industry. In the ballad, the writer waxes lyrically about the natural beauty and glorious history of Scotland, and loyally affirms that 'The Queen to our country is true'.

Queen Victoria made her first tour of Scotland in 1842, five years after succeeding to the crown and two years after her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg. The precedent for visiting Scotland had been re-established by George IV in 1822 - the first royal visit to Scotland for over 150 years. It was upon this visit that Albert and Victoria, especially, fell in love with the Scottish Highlands. The couple would eventually go on to purchase the Balmoral estate, in 1852. This provided the family with a relatively peaceful and secluded holiday home.

This song should be sung to the tune 'Up in the mornin' early'. There is woodcut of a comfortable looking, well-dressed man supping wine in a parlour.
The allusions to the Queen and the Provost in this song mean that it most likely to referred to Queen Victoria's visit to Edinburgh in 1842. The Lord Provost at the time was Jemmie Forrest, and unfortunately for his career, some of the plans for her official welcome did not go well. The main incident was when the Edinburgh guard of honour and the Queen's bodyguards mistook each other for assassins and scuffle broke out! There were many broadsides published at the time which accused Forrest of sleeping when he should have been paying attention.

The broadside carries no publication details.
This ballad is narrated by a 'Professor Nimmo', and involves him leaving Stirling for Argyllshire and bidding farewell to the 'ladies he met there'. Professor Nimmo implies that he has made several of these women pregnant, and his hasty departure may have something to do with this. A famous 'History of Stirlingshire', first  published in 1777, was written by the Rev. William Nimmo of Bothkennar, who was regarded as an accomplished scholar. However, there is no evidence that he may be connected to the 'Professor Nimmo' of this ballad.

The second ballad begins: 'On Monday night I married a wife, / I thought we'd live happy life.' This sheet carries two illustrative woodcuts depicting Robert Burns and a rustic couple.
The topic of the first song, Burns's (1756-96) statue in Dundee, suggests this sheet was published there, although the topic has a popular appeal and so may not have been confined to Dundee. The statue was unveiled in Dundee in 1880 and was a copy of that commissioned by the city of New York and unveiled only weeks before. The commission was completed by Sir John Robert Steell (1804-91), who based his casting on Alexander Nasmyth's (1758-1840) portrait of 1787. As a result the likeness is believed to be quite accurate and conforms with the public image of Burns.",Broadside ballads entitled 'The Proposed Burns Statue in Dundee' and 'The Woeful Marriage',1880

Ballads and broadsides were one of the few forms of mass entertainment available to the populace before the advent of television and radio. The sheets would often be bought and then shared around or read out aloud. The topics were often down to earth and no doubt would have been instantly recognisable to those in the audience, like this example here. The feel-good factor of this triumph over adversity ballad would probably have made it a fairly popular purchase.

This erudite broadside appears to be a satire against organised religion. Given the religious nature of the recurring civil wars that took place in Scotland, England and Ireland during this era (note the Latin subtitle's emphasis on alternating periods of peace and turbulence), this sheet would have caused some controversy among its audience.

This broadside was priced at one penny and published on Saturday, 21st May 1870, by the Poet's Box. The town of publication has been obscured, but was probably Glasgow.
Legend has it that the thistle was adopted as Scotland's national emblem after a Viking invading party, approaching Scottish warriors by night, crept into a patch of thistles and began to cry out in pain, alerting the Scots to their whereabouts. Since then, the thistle has represented Scotland in artwork, advertising, football club names and many songs and poems. Perhaps the most famous usage is in 'A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle' by Hugh MacDiarmid (1892-1978). Published in 1926, it is an epic dissection of the Scottish character. 'Scotia's Thistle' is an earlier, less ambitious tribute to the beauty and independent spirit of Scotland.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

The sheet was printed by MacGibbon.
Captain Samuel Wallis was the first European to visit the tropical island Otaheiti (Tahiti) in the South Pacific. It was ruled by the Polynesian Pomare dynasty until 1880, when it became part of a French Colony, so it is likely that this broadside dates from earlier in the nineteenth century. The language and imagery adopted in the ballad is highly racist and stereotypes the native Tahitians as fat, ugly and cannibalistic.

This song was popular broadside topic and there are many examples of it from various time periods in the National Library of Scotland's collection. Although Jacobite leanings were clearly traitorous, and dangerous after 1746, this continued to be published. The strength of Catholic, Scottish and monarchists' feelings about the line of inheritance of the British throne may be gauged by publications such as this.

The poem is an elegy on 'JOHN WILSON, Esq., the Scottish Vocalist, who died in America, on the 9th July 1849.' The author was William Jamie of Gourdon Schoolhouse, and the poem is dated 7th August 1849.
Neither the subject of this elegy, the singer John Wilson, nor its author William Jamie, are remembered widely in Scotland today. Wilson, born in Edinburgh in 1800, was the compiler of 'The songs of Scotland' published during the early 1840s. He was best known as a tenor, successful in Covent Garden and Drury Lane, London and throughout the eastern seaboard of North America. He may also have been the author of another song of this site 'A new song on the dear times'. The poem suggests that Wilson was a performer of Burns's songs, and also of songs about Scotland's landscape and heroic past. These were themes which had become internationally popular during the early nineteenth century through Sir Walter Scott's novels. Burns's renown also grew during this period, and his influence is obvious in William Jamie's choice of metre and rhyme scheme, which echo Burns's song 'A Red, Red Rose'.

Andrew Park was born in Renfrew, in 1807 and educated first at Parish School and then Glasgow University. At 14 he began a job in Paisley and at 20 moved into Glasgow, working as a hat salesman. He set up a bookselling business in 1841, but after three years of struggling for success this was closed. In 1856 he travelled around Egypt, which was the inspiration for his book 'Egypt and the East. He died in Glasgow in 1893.

'Scotland Yet' was written by the poet Henry Scott Riddell (1798-1870), who became a minister in Teviotside and wrote the poem while out for a walk in a lonely glen at Teviothead. It is a song written as a toast to the beauty, history and heritage of Scotland. The subject that unites the verses is the importance of freedom, a theme that has been recurrent in Scottish culture from the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320 to the film 'Braveheart' in the 1990s. One of the champions of an older, freer Scotland that is mentioned is Ossian, the 3rd century ancient Gaelic poet whose work was 'translated' by James Macpherson (1736-96). Like that of most countries, Scotland's popular image is based as much on myth and fiction as it is on historical fact.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing.

' Below the title, there is a short note, presumably addressed to the Prince of Wales, advising him 'Tak Care on your Sell, sir, noow'.
The ambiguous reference to the 'pretended' Prince of Wales in this ballad's title, suggests that the song could be about the 'Old Pretender', James 'VIII' and 'III' - the son of James VII and II. Strangely, the verses to this ballad appear to be nonsense lyrics, although the tone of the piece is certainly not deferential. As with people's political opinions during this turbulent and dangerous era, this song can swing both ways.

As this broadside contains a sentimental and nostalgic ballad on the subject of the failed Jacobite Risings, it must have been written long after 1746. With an end of verse refrain to remind people that these events took place a long time ago, the ballad praises Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobite Clans, while it criticises the Hanoverian King, George I, and his heirs. The woodcut on this broadside is especially interesting, as the imagery clearly alludes to the famous 'king o'er the water' theme, in addition to showing traditional Jacobite symbols such as the white cockade and the toasting glass.

Watson (1664-1722), was one of the King's printers for Scotland. King's printers had exclusive rights to print acts of Parliament, proclamations, the Authorised Version of the Bible, the metrical psalmsand catechism, amongst others. It appears that this is not one of those; indeed, the piece seems to be harshly critical of organised religion, saying the 'Dragons of the Church . . . make others Martyrs to make themselves Saints'.

This broadside focuses on Britain's foreign policy during the 1850s. The Austrians and Russians, under Tsar Nicolas I, were forming an alliance, mainly to gain supremacy over the Turks in the Balkan States and the Crimean Coast. Britain's government at the time, a Liberal-Conservative coalition led by George Hamilton Gordon, Lord Aberdeen, refused to acknowledge the new Russian threat, however. This broadside's prediction of Russian aggression would prove to be true as Britain entered into the Crimean War in 1854.
This style of text, with its implicit political propaganda, would not only have made for compelling entertainment, but would also perhaps have stimulated political thought, reasoning and debate.","Broadside ballad entitled 'The Russians Are Coming! Or, the Finishing Stroke'",1854

This is the only extant occurrence of these three elements, these lyrics and two melodies, coming to together in one song. The melodies were old in the eighteenth century and had their own anonymous lyrics. Allan Ramsay (1686-1757), however, used the melody in his 'Tea-Table Miscellany' (1724-27), where he wrote another set of lyrics and included a further set. These are not the same as those carried on this broadside.

This ballad is a celebration of the Battle of Alma, which took place during the Crimean War, in September 1854. The battle featured combined French and British forces arrayed against a Russian army, but the ultimate rout of the Russians was forced by the well-disciplined Highland Brigade, comprising 3 battalions: the  93rd Highlanders, the Cameron Highlanders, and the Black Watch. In the ballad, the phrase 'bonnets sae blue' refers to the blue bonnets worn by the Black Watch.

Illustrated with a spectacular and intriguing woodcut, this broadside appears to be celebrating the secret history and existence of freemasonry. The key, hammer, sword and evil eye all appear to be symbols of freemasonry, though because such organisations are cloaked in secrecy, it is difficult to decode the meaning of this woodcut. However, with its altar and candles, the woodcut most likely represents some sort of traditional, quasi-religious ceremony. The ballad itself makes many references to biblical stories, while the Bible that appears in the woodcut is mysteriously opened at the Old Testament chapter called 'Kings'.

The ballad was to be sung 'To a New Tune', not named, and was published by John Moncur of Sclater's Close in Edinburgh, in 1707.
The narrator of this ballad is extolling the virtues of an 'innocent' life in the country above a sinful existence in the town. Some of the early eighteenth century's racial prejudices and beliefs are revealed in verse two, where the narrator compares urban dwellers to 'cannibals' in the 'Eastern Regions' who are 'eas'd of all Religion'. In this period, many Scots would only have recognised Presbyterianism as a true religion. There is a certain amount of hypocrisy about the narrator, however, as he condemns townspeople as drunkards while professing his love for 'Wine that Warms the Noddle'.

Written by the County Kerry poet Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin, this patriotic song is a eulogy to the martial glories of Great Britain and the famous English admiral, George Rodney (1719-92). Rodney served in the Seven Years' War and, in April 1782, won a famous victory over Count de Grasse's French fleet at the islets called the Saintes, near Dominica. Known as the Battle of the Saints, Rodney's resounding victory meant that the West Indies remained under British control. The ballad proudly takes the audience into the heat of the battle and, revealingly, the narrator places great emphasis on forging a British identity through fighting wars against the French and Spanish.

Although the sheet is not dated and the publisher is not named, a note below the title states that 'Copies can always be had at 80 London Street', one of the addresses of the Glasgow Poet's Box.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson. 
As suggested by the word 'Scotch' in the title, this broadside is a light-hearted attack on the Scots language by an English writer who considers himself superior, simply because he speaks 'proper' English. After providing his audience with a list of Scots words, he tells of a humorous escapade that occurred when an English lady was touring in Scotland. On retiring to bed, Lady Delacour's servant advised her that, to stay warm, she should sleep with a 'pig' in her bed. As 'pig' is a Scots word for 'hot water bottle', a series of delicate - and amusing - misunderstandings arise from this awkward situation.

James Watson was a prolific broadside printer who operated in Edinburgh between 1695 and 1722. His father had taken over the publishing house of Colmar and Solingen, and so he had inherited a solid business to begin with. Many of his broadsides were on religious topics, like this one, and reflected many of the religious and political tensions of the time. Here both Catholic and Protestant strongholds are being attacked.

The sheet was published by William Anderson, at the Poet's Box, Paisley. A woodcut of a mother and child, framed by a border of foliage, adorns the top of the sheet.
The note at the bottom of this sheet states that the Paisley Poet's Box is 'Free Burgage Territory'. 'Burgage' was an old system whereby land was leased directly from the crown, and was not taxed. In Paisley, there was a very similar system, called a 'booking tenure', where the land belonged to the burgh, rather than the crown. This is probably the sort of lease Anderson held. It would have been attractive to potential customers as the fact that he paid no tax would hopefully have meant a better value product. It is not known whether the Paisley Poet's Box was related to those in Dundee, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Belfast.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century.

The lyrics to this song are comprised mainly of a pastiche of parts, or titles, of other well-known songs, especially those of Robert Burns (1759-96). Unfortunately, although probably intentional, the way these snippets of other songs have been arranged does not always make sense.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s.

Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs.

Written in the lofty style of a martial epic, this political ballad is written from the viewpoint of the Whig Party, as they seek to challenge the Tories and the Radicals. It seems likely that the obscure title for the ballad is a reference to a poem by Robert Southey (1774-1843), who, due to his toadying to the Establishment, was a much-ridiculed poet laureate. Roderick, Last of the Goths, was the last in the Visigothic line of kings in Spain, being dethroned by the African Moors in 711.

Perhaps a more suitable title for this ballad would have been 'A Sailor's Misadventures in Edinburgh'! It acts as a warning to any young man tempted to stray into one of the alehouses or taverns in Edinburgh's High Street, where there are women waiting to relieve them of their money.

There are other copies of these lyrics to 'a pleasant new tune' held in the National Library of Scotland's collection. This lamentation genre has its origins in the Bible. The Lamentations of Jeremiah detailed Judah's desolation at the Fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC to the Babylonian King, Nebuchadnezzar. Thereafter a tradition developed to express grief for the dead, with the poems being written in a special metre called 'elegiac'. Lamentation eventually became a traditional Scottish expression of grief, accompanied by bagpipes, at clan funerals.

This song follows the very traditional theme of the emigrant's longing for home. The narrator is reminisces about his homeland, its people and its culture. The folksongs of Scotland are especially dear to him. Broadside ballads often mention other, more famous songs in their lyrics to evoke a memory or feeling, and this one is no exception.

This ballad is a lament sung by a grieving young widow for her husband, who has been drowned on the rocks of Gibraltar, after being recruited to fight in a war. The narrative structure of this ballad is quite complicated, with contributions from the husband, wife, wife's mother and the anonymous narrator. Despite the young husband's death, the writer of the ballad tries to end on a positive note by reminding the grieving widow that she is young and can learn to love again. Although not dated, the references to the songs, 'Death of Nelson' and 'The Iron Horse' (a nickname for an early steam locomotive), in the advertisement at the bottom of the sheet, suggest that the ballad would probably have been written some time after 1820.

The skills gained, clothes provided and food are all highlighted in favour of the soldier's job. Britain at this time was still an empire and so had armed units deployed in most of her territory. Britain was also involved in two conflicts during this era, one in Sudan and one in Burma which meant more men and resources would have been required.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

16357,ballad,RB.m.143(051),"This ballad begins: 'Wild blew the gale in Gibralter one night, / As a soldier lay stretched in his cell; / And anon, 'mid the darkness, the moon's silver light / On his countenance dreamily fell.' The broadside was published by the Poet's Box in Dundee. Beneath the title it is noted that the song was 'Recited with Great Success by D. WILKIE of DUNDEE'.
'Soldier's Pardon' recounts the tale of an English soldier sentenced to death for striking a cruel superior in a fit of temper. The song is dominated by a moving conversation between the soldier, Joe, and his comrade Tom, who is trusted with delivering Joe's last words to his loved ones in Devonshire. At the end of the song, however, Joe is pardoned, and the last image is of him reunited with his sweetheart. Such songs, featuring soldiers and sailors parted from their loved ones, were frequently featured on broadsides.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.

It was to be sung to the tune of 'The Blaeberries' and was published by W. Reid of Leith. Included at the top of the sheet is a woodcut illustration.
The picturesque town of Innerleithen is nestled in the Tweed Valley, approximately six miles east of Peebles. In the nineteenth century it was a popular spa town, where people flocked to experience the curative properties of the mineral spring. The inspiration for Walter Scott's fictional spa town of St Ronan's is said to have been Innerleithen. Soon after the publication of Scott's book, 'St Ronan's Well' (1823), the name was adopted for the Innerleithen well.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information  such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day. Cheaply available, they were sold on the streets by pedlars and chapmen.

The footnote belonging to the star in the first line, explains that 'Geordie' is the Railway. The lyrics should be sung to the tune, 'Sow's Tail to Geordie'.
This sheet is an excellent example of the function of broadside literature in its society. To the modern reader the meaning of this text is virtually unintelligible and its point is quite lost. To readers of the day, however, who were familiar with the breaking news stories, slang and euphemisms of the day, this story would have probably been at the sharper end of the entertainment market.

This sheet was published by the printer William Carse.
Robert Stirrat was a very popular name in the south-west of Scotland during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As a result, this ballad may have been more of a moral warning than a factual report of the events. Broadside publishers, even at this time, tended to see themselves as moral guardians and teachers in society. As such publishers often disseminated 'educational' texts outlining the social and personal consequences of undisciplined behaviour.

It appears from this broadside that Boghouse was standing for election as a Whig candidate. The author of this ballad does not look upon him or his politics favourably, and instead encourages people to vote for his opponent, Aytoun. Whilst there appears to be little or no information available on Boghouse, it seems likely that Aytoun was in fact James Aytoun (1797-1881), the well-known Radical who stood for election as member of parliament for Edinburgh during the 1830s.

Without at least an initial attached to the name Sanderson, it is difficult to know exactly which printer is mentioned here and, therefore, even more difficult to give this piece a time frame. It could be one of the Sanderson family associated with the Edinburgh Poet's Box. The text is about Sir James Ross - the 'the' in the title is to give the name a highland air, as this is how it would have been translated from Gaelic - and his love Matilda. The whole piece finishes with a 'Romeo and Juliet'-esque ending as Matilda throws herself on the sword which has just killed her lover James.
The Edinburgh Poet?s Box was in operation from around 1852 until about 1910. William Sanderson and from 1867 his son John had premises in the Canongate. The business passed over to John?s brother Charles in 1902. Few of the Sanderson broadsides bear the name Poet?s Box, but it is certain than the shop became known in Edinburgh at the Poet?s Box.  It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box.

This sheet was published by the Poet's Box of the Overgate, Dundee, and includes a small illustration of a young girl holding up the edge of her skirt and curtseying. It is unusual to find five songs appearing on one broadside. Whilst it was reasonably common for two ballads to appear together, the majority of sheets only featured one ballad. The Dundee Poet's Box appears to have realised the attraction of the larger sheets and continued to produce them in significant quantities. Although it is not clear how much they sold for, the broadside-buying public probably believed the larger sheets were good value for money.

The main piece of contextual information given in this ballad is in the tenth stanza, 'With India's trophies round his bier', referring to the British Empire's colonial interests in India. The song is supposed to comfort the widow who has lost her husband and whose life is now in turmoil. To comfort her further lists of Scotland's great military leaders and her battles have been included, to add to her husband's heroic status.

Unfortunately, no publication details are included on the broadside. However, a note at the foot of the sheet identifies the writer as 'Pte. J. Sibbald, 1st Black Watch'.
Apparently written by a private in the Black Watch, the themes explored in this ballad are almost identical to the points that Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) raises in his famous poem, 'Tommy Atkins'. This private believes that the public should show far more respect for soldiers, considering that they so bravely sacrifice their lives in service of their country. The reality, however, claims the soldier, is that soldiers are treated like outcasts who, even if they survive the fighting, are most likely to die impoverished in the workhouse. The recurring theme of this ballad is a request to the public for respect and understanding towards British soldiers, and recognition that a 'rough exterior' can often hide 'the beauty of a soul'.

Illustrated with woodcuts depicting religious images, this broadside appears to be a political ballad in support of the Irish Home Rule Movement. The writer makes repeated references to a female character called Granua (also spelt Grainne). The daughter of the mythical Irish warrior and folk hero, Finn McCool, Granua is also used as a symbol for Ireland - much like the figure of Britannia is employed as a symbol for Great Britain. Another interesting reference is the inclusion of the famous phrase, 'The Rights of Man', which suggests that the writer was familiar with the anti-establishment works of Thomas Paine (1737-1809).

Details such as date and place of publication and printer were not always given on broadsides. They were produced quickly and cheaply to satisfy a mass audiences' entertainment needs. They have only survived today because they interested later collectors, perhaps because of their variety and impermanence.

Three fieldworkers are visible in the background.
This ballad tells the tale of a ship carpenter's wife who was put up for auction, and bought for ten shillings by a sailor. Although this ballad is light-hearted and deals with the subject humorously, there were in fact genuine cases of women being sold by their husbands. At a time when a married woman was considered to be nothing more than a possession, both by her husband and the law, such practices did occur. The National Library of Scotland's collection includes one broadside detailing the sale of a woman, named Mary MacKenzie, on the 16th July, 1828, in Edinburgh's Grassmarket.

It was published by William Smith of 3 Bristo Port, Edinburgh, and includes an elaborate illustration of a showman surrounded by interested onlookers.
Although there is no publication date on this broadside, it is known that William Smith resided at 3 Bristo Port between 1824 and 1829. He was also working from premises at 47 Crosscauseway, Edinburgh, around this time, which suggests that 'business was booming'. Although he produced a wide range of broadsides and chapbooks on different subjects, Smith is best remembered for his instruction booklets and works of a humorous nature. The person in the centre of the illustration is Daft Jamie, (James Wilson) who is referred to in the text. Jamie was a well-known character in Edinburgh, who entertained local children with riddles and jokes. Jamie, who was just 18 years old, was murdered by Burke and Hare in October 1828.

He was a considerable intellectual force and was a close friend of literary luminaries such as William Wordsworth and Robert Southey.

We are told that he frequented the Shakespeare Saloon, which was in the Saltmarket, the principal area of the city for broadside publishing. Sung to the tune of 'Mr Cullen's Glasgow A B C', it begins, 'In this age of wonder, of fasion and delight, / Glasgow is the place of many a funny sight'. No printer is named but it is dated the morning of Saturday, May 2nd 1857, but it probably comes from the Glasgow Poet's Box.
The composition of these verses is rather amateurish but adds to the charm of this interesting ballad. Several prominent places in Glasgow are mentioned, and some commentary given on each. It concludes by mentioning the Shakespeare Saloon, its owner Mr Levy, and the fact that you can find Charlie Watson, the balladeer, there and he's 'always glad to see you'.

Lindsay worked from this address during the 1850s and so this sheet was probably published sometime during that decade. Many of Lindsay's sheets carry illustrations but they are often to compensate for short lyrics or flimsy content. Here, these lyrics were so long that Lindsay has even missed out some of his trademark, lengthy advertising.

Ballads about sea captains and sailors appear to have been very popular in Scotland. This is hardly surprising, given the proliferation of harbours and ports around Scotland, and the importance of shipping routes to Scottish trade and the economy. This example tells the story of how the local squire and his servants cuckolded the captain while he was at sea for eight months. Upon his return his entire female staff were delivered of children. He forgave his wife, however, as he fathered a child in the West Indies whilst travelling!
It is fairly unusual for the topics of procreation, pregnancy and confinement to be discussed in such open detail, as they were considered to be socially unacceptable and bad mannered. It is reassuring to know, however, that people were only human, and were more than aware of the realities of their society and the situations around them.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The Sea Captain',1820-

Many Scots emigrated to North America and to Australia in the eighteenth, nineteenth and even twentieth centuries. Although the geographical references in this poem suggest that it is narrated by a Lowlander, the greatest concentration of migrants came from the Highlands. Some of these were forced migrations, after landowners had cleared the people off their ancestral lands to make way for sheep. In the nineteenth century, the failure of the potato crop during the 1840s again increased numbers leaving the Highlands. The exodus inevitably inspired many laments, of which this is one example.

A note below the title states that the ballad should be sung to the tune of 'O'er the Hills and Far Awa', which is a traditional English folk song. Although there are no publication details for this sheet, the ballad's reference to 'King and Country' suggests that it was most likely published some time between 1778 and 1837.
This regimental song celebrates the martial qualities of the Royal Edinburgh Volunteers, also known as the 80th Regiment of Foot. Formed in 1778, this regiment was originally recruited during the American War of Independence, and fought at Yorktown in October 1781. As the regiment surrendered at Yorktown, however, it is perhaps not surprising that the author instead focuses on the regiment's glorious successes against the French and Spanish. It seems that the regiment was disbanded in 1790, only to be reformed in 1793 as the 80th (Staffordshire Volunteers) Regiment of Foot. It could be that the song was employed by troops as a marching song.

The broadside was published by Pitts at the Toy and Marble Warehouse, 6 Great St Andrew Street in the Seven Dials area of London.
'Scots Wha Hae' is one of the most famous and popular songs by Robert Burns (1759-96), and appears on several broadsides held by the National Library of Scotland. In a letter to George Thomson (1757-1851), who composed the music for many of Burns's songs, the poet explained that he had written the patriotic words to fit a pipe air that he believed had been Robert Bruce's march at the Battle of Bannockburn. An indication of the spread of Burns's popularity beyond Scotland is given by the fact that this broadside was published in London, in an area called Seven Dials, which was historically the centre of broadside publishing in England's capital.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

This scathing attack on the proposed union of the Scottish and English parliaments is believed to have been written by John Hamilton, Lord Belhaven (1656-1708) in response to Daniel Defoe's work 'The Vision' (1706), which extolled the idea of union. Defoe (1660-1731) worked in Scotland as an unofficial agent of the English government, gauging response to the talk of union and also, to some extent, trying to sell the idea. The Act of Union was eventually ratifed in 1707 despite the opposition of Belhaven and other Scots politicians. In the 1720s, the Scottish poet Allan Ramsay (1686-1758) published a pastiche of Defoe's 'The Vision'.

'Callan' or 'callant' is Scots for a 'young man' or a 'lad'. A note under the title informs the reader that new songs are issued every week and can be bought from the Poet's Box. A list of other available songs, including 'A Happy New-Year tae ye a'' and 'Birks o' Green Balgay', is given at the bottom of the sheet.
Unfortunately, there appears to be little known about the Poet's Boxes that sprang up in most of the major Scottish towns, including Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee. Although they printed and distributed in a similar way to many other broadside producers, they also published material upon request. This provided impecunious writers with the opportunity to have their work published cheaply.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

Below the title, it is stated that this new song is sung to the tune of 'The Turks are all Confounded'.
This ballad is a celebration of the Scotch-Indian-company, better known as the Darien Company. Formed in 1695, the company's aim was to establish colonies that Scotland could use for trading purposes. A lengthy ballad, most of the verses make extravagant claims for the success that the company will achieve. However, the company never recovered from its disastrous attempt to set up a Scottish colony in Darien, Panama, in 1698, and it consequently folded in 1707. The failure of the Darien Company was a massive blow to Scottish confidence, and was one of the main reasons for the Union of 1707.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day. Cheaply available, they were sold on the streets by pedlars and chapmen. Broadsides offer a valuable insight into many aspects of the society they were published in, and the National Library of Scotland holds over 250,000 of them.","Broadside ballad entitled 'Trade's Release: or, Courage to the Scotch-Indian-Company'",1699-
14978,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(50),"Verse 1: 'Of all the Scottish northern chiefs, / Of high and mightty name, / The bravest was Sir James the Rose, / A knight of meikle fame.' This ballad was published on 23rd January 1869 by the Poet's Box, London Street, Glasgow, priced one penny.
Although this ballad was published in 1869, it has the hallmarks of the older oral folk ballad tradition. Combat between a handsome young knight and a corrupt old lord was a recurring theme, and the tragic ending, where the young man sacrifices himself for love, was also quite common. The verse form of this ballad, with four-stress and three-stress lines alternating and  second and fourth lines rhyming, was the most frequently-used form in Scotland, and was known as 'common measure'.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were.

This broadside was published by William Shephard at the Poet's Box in Dundee. The 'words and patter' were written by Alex Melville, the music was by Sam Tute and the song was 'sung with great success' by W.F. Frame.
The verses of this song are linked with passages of comic 'patter' which elaborate on the song and digress into various other topics. The song, and these interjections, were clearly designed for performance to an audience, perhaps in a music hall. Music halls were the most popular venues for public entertainment in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, and it is probable that the broadside dates from this era. The lyricist, Alex Melville, is likely to be the Alex Melville who collaborated on songs with the pre-eminent Scots entertainer of the time, Harry Lauder (1870-1950).

The broadside was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow. It is not dated, but was probably published either between 1852 and 1859, or between 1891 and 1894, when Lindsay is known to have had premises at 9 King Street.
'The Sea!', written around 1837, is the best known work of the minor English poet Bryan Waller Procter or 'Barry Cornwall' (1787-1874). Procter was born in Leeds but spent most of his time in London, where his poetry and biographies were published and his plays performed. Although he is remembered for little more than 'The Sea' today, Procter's work was popular during his lifetime and attracted praise from poets such as Charles Lamb (1775-1834) and A.C. Swinburne (1837-1909), who are regarded now as far greater writers.

This sheet was published in London for 'wholesale and retail'. The exact location of the publisher has been obscured.
This broadside contains a strange combination of songs. The second is a despairing tale of love lost. The first, 'Scots Wha Hae', is a hymn to Scottish independence written by Robert Burns. It was intended to be sung to an old Scots air, 'Hey, tuttie taitie', which was traditionally thought to have been Robert the Bruce's marching song at Bannockburn. When Burns wrote 'Scots Wha Hae' in 1794, the French Republic had just declared war on Britain, and publication of the song was delayed until 1799 because of its perceived revolutionary sympathies.",Broadside ballads entitled 'Scots Wha Hae and 'And has She then Fail'd in her Truth',1880-1900

The text preceding it reads: 'R------- P------'s Complaint of his hard Fate, / OR THE / Town Officer's Lament for the Loss of his Coat. / To the Tune of the bonny Boat Man.' A woodcut has been included to make the sheet a more attractive purchase.
Town Officers carried out a variety of functions, although many of their duties would eventually be performed by the modern day police. They also carried out civil functions like carrying the council minute books and escorting parties to church. The job came with steady pay, good perks and a certain amount of authority and social standing - all of this made it really quite attractive. They were often issued with red coats and cudgels as symbols of and tools to reinforce this authority and cachet. Unfortunately they also had a reputation for hard drinking and this resulted in a high turnover of employees.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.",Broadside ballad entitled 'Town Officer's Lament',1730

The second ballad begins: 'THE morning broke in blushes o'er me / As up the sunny hills I stray'd, / A beautious form appeared before me, When thus I spoke the lovely maid.'
The first ballad is about a cobbler, Toby Brad. Initially the reader is led to believe that, whilst at work mending shoes, he is visited by the devil. However, events take a comic turn when he discovers it was only some young boys trying to 'funk' or scare him. The second ballad is a traditionally romantic love song.","Broadside ballad entitled 'Toby Brad' or 'Funking the Cobbler', and 'Sweet Rose of Yarrow'",1880-1900

The ballad was written by J*** A*******. The sheet was published by J. and R. Childs of Bungay, Suffolk, on the 9th May 1822.
This dramatic narrative conveys the machinations of J.C.'s decision-making process. He has been invited to move from his present location, which is not given, into Edinburgh. The worries of employment, housing and moving to a new residency, however, play on his mind. This text gives his 'inner' arguments both for and against such a spontaneous life choice.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative. Broadside authors tended to see themselves as moral guardians and teachers in society. As such, publishers often disseminated 'educational' texts outlining the social and personal consequences of undisciplined or immoral behaviour.",Broadside ballad entitled 'To J*** C***** A Southron',1822
15039,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(86a),"Verse 1: 'Tho' I mingle in the throng / Of the happy and the gay, / From the mirth of dance and song / I would fain be far away; / For I love to use no wile, / And can but deem it sin, / That the brow should wear a smile / When the soul is sad within. / Tho' a parent's stern command / Claims obedience from me, / O, 'tis hard to give the hand / Where the heart can never be.' This song was published by the Poet's Box. The town or city is not specified, but it was probably published in Dundee.
This is clearly a song dissenting against something or somone, but exactly what or who is left unsaid. The title, which is also the song's refrain, emphasises that it is difficult to show loyalty to something or someone when one feels that loyalty is not merited. The song also mentions 'a parent's stern command' claiming 'obedience', but whether this refers literally to a person, or whether the 'parent' is a metaphor for a religious creed, or the government, or some other power, is again elusive. Broadside ballads expressing political or ideological dissent were quite numerous, and were often more directly critical than this song.

Throughout the ballad, the nostalgic 'Lichtie' recalls people and places from his childhood, and closes by stating that, come what may, he will be buried in the grounds of Arbroath Abbey. Given that the subject of the poem is an emigrant who now lives across 'the deep sea', it seems likely that this ballad reflects the nostalgic emotions of the thousands of Scots who, from 1700 onwards, emigrated to the New World of North America and far-off places in the British Empire.                                                                                                                                                          The Dundee Poets?

Below the title we are told that 'This popular song can always be had at 80 London Street, Glasgow', which was the address of the Poet's Box. A further note states that the ballad was to be sung to an original air, while a footnote identifies the publication date as Saturday the 29th of January, 1887.
Using a faded flower from childhood as the central image and symbol of the ballad, this whimsically melancholic song muses on the subject of why we save seemingly trifling things for sentimental reasons. The author then goes on to consider how revealing it is that we often attach more value to our keepsakes, than we do to valuable jewels. Below the ballad, there is an advertisement informing the public about the wide range of publishing services that the Poet's Box can offer its customers. From reading this list, it seems that W.M. Leitch's business could publish just about anything that the public might want, regardless of geographical location.

Broadside songs are often anonymous and difficult to date, mainly because they are based in the oral, communal tradition. This song is no exception. Its themes of rural Scotland, marriage and a wedding feast would have been instantly recognisable to most people. The chorus is also a meaningless but tuneful and repetitive ditty which is a feature of songs from the oral tradition. This made them easier to remember and allowed for greater audience participation.

Published by James Lindsay from 9 King Street, Glasgow, this sheet also incorporates an illustration of a pretty basket of wild flowers above the title. This helps to enhance the mood of the ballad. 'Tid' is the Scots word for mood.
This ballad addresses two very popular themes: marriage and parental guidance. The daughter of the piece is in the mood to marry, but has no particular preference. Meanwhile, her mother thinks she should wait until someone trustworthy manifests and enjoy her freedom in the meantime. It is not revealed who wins the argument! It is revealing of attitudes of the time that the daughter feels she has long been ready to marry despite being only sixteen, while her mother, more normally, married at 14.

It was to be sung to an 'Original' tune, was priced at one penny, and was published on Saturday, 25th September 1869 by the Poet's Box in Glasgow.
The theme of lovers separated was a common one in the ballad tradition from the earliest days. Often the ballad would be narrated by a young woman left at home while her lover pursued some romantic or heroic vocation, perhaps as a soldier, a sailor, or a traveller. This later song offers a less common perspective, being narrated by the traveller rather than the lover left at home, but it is still a touching evocation of loneliness, as the narrator describes looking at the stars from the deck of his ship and dreaming of his family and his sweetheart.

The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills.

This amusing ballad lists a number of funny episodes that result from a man?s forgetfulness and absent-mindedness. In addition to losing such objects as his spectacles and dress suite, however, it seems that the husband in this ballad is so absent-minded that he can even forget about his wife's whereabouts! Many light-hearted broadside ballads such as this one are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

This is a good example of the political use of the broadside genre. Many of the publications were anonymous and the author of the lyrics was likewise unknown. It often cost money to record these two pieces of information, and besides, these were the older equivalents of 'tomorrow's fish and chip wrappings'. The audience reached by broadsides was vast and fairly up to date on topical news due to the proliferation of publications. It means that much of the symbolism and shorthand is lost to us today but would have been immediately recognisable then. As a result this genre was an ideal forum for cutting-edge criticism and idealism.

Below the title we are told that 'This popular song can always be had at the Poet's Box 182 OVERGATE, DUNDEE'.
This thoughtful and whimsical ballad muses on the subject of why we save seemingly trifling things, such as a flower or a lock of hair, for sentimental reasons. Employing a faded flower from childhood as the central image of the ballad, the writer shows how we treasure such mementoes in order to inspire happy memories of the past. The writer then goes on to ponder how interesting it is that we often attach more value to our keepsakes, than we do to rare jewels. In short, this melancholic ballad appears to comment on the paradoxical manner in which the past exists in the present for us, and concludes by reminding us about the transient nature of life.

Chorus: 'Mush a ring a do a da, fal lal da do da addy, / Mush a ring a do a da, there's whisky in the jar.' This broadside was printed by the Poet's Box, 80 London Street, Glasgow, on 'Saturday morning, Dec. 16, 1871'.
As this was a popular song the Poet's Box published it on a number of occasions, including around 1850 when they had premises at 6 St Andrew's Lane, Glasgow. An advert offering to post songs 'to any part of the country' upon receipt of the correct number of postage stamps has been included along with a catalogue of the most recent songs available from the Poet's Box.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?!

Unfortunately, little is known about the composer and performer Harry Linn. He appears to have been a popular entertainer in the Music Halls of the late nineteenth century, performing his own compositions to large audiences. The broadside-buying public would have likely been familiar with his name, and its inclusion on this sheet probably guaranteed healthy sales. Another of his compositions, which he wrote in the 1870s, was entitled 'A Country Life'. It begins: 'I love to roam through the bright, green fields'.

A note below the title states that this ballad was 'Written by D. Milligan, sung T. Ball, of Dundee', and that 'Copies of this can be had at the Pox Box, Overgat, Dundee'.
Employing the familiar metaphor of life being a hazardous sea journey with many perils, this sombre - yet warm-hearted - ballad tells of how the more fortunate people should help those fellow travellers who end up stranded on the rocks. The chorus strongly reinforces this Christian message of being a good Samaritan to those in trouble, and giving them a place by the fireside. Although not dated, the ballad vaguely hints at some episode that recently led to loss of life around Scotland's shores - hence the sentiment of the song's message.

The broadside was published by James Lindsay of King Street in Gasgow. It is not dated.
This song is about a young man forced by poverty to leave his country and the woman he loves to join the army. This was a common topic in broadside ballads, and 'The Bonnie Lasses' Answer' was clearly a popular example of the genre, that was reprinted by various broadside publishers. This version includes a woodcut illustration to make it attractive to audiences. The title refers to the final line of the chorus, when the 'Bonnie Lass' cries 'no, no' in response to her sweetheart's decision to leave.

The name of the publisher is not included.
Written in a triumphalist tone, this broadside ballad was ghost-written from the viewpoint of the English sea-captain, Thomas Green, who was executed at Leith in 1705 on a trumped-up charge of piracy. Invoking the memory of William Wallace and capitalising 'SCOTS' and 'GOD' throughout the ballad, the anonymous Scottish writer uses Captain Green?s dreadful fate as a warning to other Englishmen not to 'wrong the SCOTS'. Since the context for this tragic story is the failure of the Darien Company and the scheming of unscrupulous politicians participating in the Union negotiations, this broadside might well have been used as anti-Union rhetoric.

Opening with a sermon-like introduction, this instructional broadside is all about the strength that a person can possess if they believe in God. To spread the message, the sheet employs a sentimental narrative concerning two small boys from London, who heroically journey through a godless wilderness to Haddington, Edinburgh.These orphans, whose parents were killed by a fever, are offered six shilling for their sole possession, a bible. However, the boys claim that they would rather starve than sell their bible. The moral of the tale seems to be that those who place their faith in the Lord will be provided for.

The abuse of alcohol is now closely associated with nineteenth-century Britain - with gin and beer automatically featuring in today's perception of the period. It must have also been a recognised problem at the time as the 1830s and 1840s saw an increase in the spread of the temperance movement. This ballad, however, is a fight back against temperance. The exact importance of 'writer Anderson' is largely lost on today's readers though, illustrating the ephemeral role of the sheet.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day.

'llk' means 'each', 'drouthie' means 'thirsty' and a 'gill-stoup' is a tumbler or pitcher that holds one gill of fluid.
In this song the narrator describes the experiences that persuaded him to give up drinking alcohol. There are no publication details, making it difficult to tell when the song dates from. Despite Scotland's reputation for hard drinking, the country has had a strong temperance movement for almost two hundred years. The movement reached its height in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when various local authorities voted areas of their jurisdictions free from licensed premises, or 'dry', under the local veto acts.

The theme of this broadside - the dangers of drink - is a very common one. Indeed, many of the crime-related broadsides held by the National Library of Scotland cite alcohol as mainly, or solely, responsible for criminal behaviour. Similarly here, a spell in the 'Teetotal Mill' is named as a cure for disease, marital problems, bad language, financial troubles and weakness - alcohol having been the root cause of these ills.

Daniel O'Connell (1775-1847), known as 'the Liberator' for his role in achieving Catholic Emancipation, was the leader of the powerful Repeal Association, whose aim was to repeal the Act of Union (1800) between Britain and Ireland thus gaining total Irish emancipation. After numerous political manoeuvring, O'Connell organised rallies which became so well attended that they were named 'monster meetings'. The meeting at Tara, Co. Meath in the summer of 1843, is now estimated to have been attended by 750,000 people.

This risque ballad tells the story of a lowly soldier who, due to his legendary prowess with his sword, ends up working as a personal servant for the colonel's wife. Although this promotion might sound like a step up in the world, the jealous colonel ends up shooting the soldier in the groin.

This song was to be sung to an 'Original' tune. The broadside, priced one penny, was published on Saturday, 4th June 1870 by the Poet's Box, probably in Glasgow.
This song focuses on African-American slaves and ex-slaves in the United States of America. The black cotton workers are portrayed as fortunate and happy in their work and relaxation. There are even references to them being free, and being paid silver dollars by white men. This suggests that this ballad was written after 1865, when slave-owning was finally abolished in the U.S.A, and that it may be a piece of propaganda praising white magnanimity. In reality, the legacy of slavery was terrible prejudice and poverty, which effectively continued to enslave many African-Americans for years. Racist names in the song indicate reveal the prejudice that still existed.

16362,ballad,RB.m.143(056),"This ballad begins: 'Noo, yae simmer's nicht I gaed oot for a / walk, / An' wis daunnerin' alang by a stream, / When a bonnie bit lassie I happened tae / meet, / She wis spreadin' oot claes on the green.' Sung by J.G. Roy with great success, this song could be purchased from 192 Overgate, Dundee, for one penny.
The verses of this comic song are interposed with spoken passages, which offer insightful comments on the events unfolding in the song. If performed well, as it clearly was by J.G. Roy, this style of composition would have been particularly popular with audiences. The comic 'patter' created an immediate intimacy and rapport between the performer and those listening. The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection includes several other songs written in this style, including 'The Dooley Fitba' Club' and 'The Storm on the Paisley Canal'.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

Below the title we are given detailed information about the poet and his published works. A 'tollman' collected tolls from travellers on turnpike roads. 'Canty' means cheerful and 'callants' is 'an affectionate term for lads'.
Written by Peter McLennan, this light-hearted broadside ballad is dedicated to a tollman called Tammie, who lived in a tollbooth eight miles north-east of Glasgow. Judging by the verses of this ballad, it appears that Tammie's humble dwelling was a popular port of call for travellers. In addition to describing Tammy's house and style of living, the ballad also tells us much about the diversity of traffic that travelled on this road. With its references to events such as the Great Exhibition of 1851, this ballad reveals much about the social history of Victorian Scotland.

'Tam Gibb and his Sow' is a wonderful Scots comic song about a man who buys a sow and then loses control of it on his way home. The layout of the broadside, which includes transcriptions of the spoken sections between verses, marks the song very clearly as a performance piece. The song contains great examples of the vividness of the Scots language in words like 'grumphy', meaning 'pig', 'glaur', meaning 'sticky mud', 'skaith' meaning 'harm' or 'injure', and 'dree', meaning 'endure'.

Both the tune and the lyrics of this ballad were favourites of the Scottish folksinger David Kennedy (1825-7), whose memorial can be found on Calton Hill, Edinburgh. The tune is thought to have been re-written from the English folksong, 'Greensleeves'. This is one of the earliest Scottish records of the lyrics. Part of them, however, were spoken by Iago in Shakespeare's 'Othello', although he refers to King Stephen and not King Robert.

The third ballad begins: 'It was in yon meadows I carelessly did stray, / And I beheld a lady fair with some young sailor gay.' As this sheet includes three ballads for the price of one, the chapmen who sold broadsides to the public would have marketed this one as a bargain.
Although, at first glance, these three ballads might appear incongruous, 'Susan's Adventures' and 'British Man-of-War' appear to be part of a pair. For both songs tell of a young woman called Susan, whose sweetheart - William - is a sailor who serves on board a British warship. Written in a lofty and epic style, the third ballad is a commemorative song to celebrate Wellington's defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, and the French Emperor's subsequent banishment to the island of St Helena, in the South Atlantic.

This sheet addresses itself to the ridiculousness of complete inactivity on a Sabbath. There are many sheets contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection which detail Sabbath breaking. According to many of the crime reports and moral texts this is one of the gravest offences to commit and truly imperils the immortal soul.

This ballad was to be sung to the tune 'Scotland Yet'. The publisher was James Lindsay of King Street, Glasgow.
This ballad is based around an event in 1853 that came to be known as the 'Battle of Garelochhead'. Sir James Colquhoun, an owner of land around the Clyde estuary, objected to Sunday tourist cruises down the Clyde, and refused to allow day trippers on to his land. When the paddle steamer 'Emperor' tried to moor at Garelochhead pier, locals mobilised by Colquhoun barricaded the pier, but eventually were routed by the tourists, most of whom were from Glasgow.

The publisher of the broadside was James Lindsay of King Street in Glasgow.
The first of these two songs is probably a reaction to an incident from 1853, when the paddle steamer 'Emperor' was banned from making Sunday cruises on the Clyde after a court battle waged by the landowner Sir James Colquhoun. Previously Sir James and his supporters in Garelochhead had physically tried to prevent tourists from disembarking from the 'Emperor' onto Colquhoun land.

This ballad deviates from the more traditional 'story' form, taking the structure of a line-about argument between man and wife. While ballad recitations often involved the performer assuming different characters or voices, the rapid-fire exchanges in this example would have been far more effective with two performers. It is thus likely that this song was written in the nineteenth century, when music halls with ensemble casts had begun to gain in popularity.

The ballad itself is followed by a publisher's note which claims that the lyrics are based on a Jacobite song, 'O Kenmure is on an' awa, Willie', but have been given a loyalist twist.

This light-hearted ballad is a satirical attack on the Sabbatarian, Sir Andrew Agnew (1793-1849), and his proposed bill to force people to observe the Sabbath more closely. The ballad-writer certainly provides his audience with an entertaining read, as he exaggerates the effects that such legislation would have in Scotland. For instance, he quips that the sheep will have to stop bleating and the cows must leant to milk themselves. Pregnant women, meanwhile, must postpone their labours until the Monday. Although the topic is treated in an amusing manner, the kirk session courts formerly possessed much power and influence over the parish, so this ballad indicates the gradual social shift that was taking place in Victorian Scotland.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box.

Many broadside producers felt it was their public duty to provide their readership with various forms of moral and religious guidance. This included publishing everything from highly repentant last speeches uttered from the gallows to the journey of the spiritual railway. In this interesting analogy, repentence is the station where people hop on board the heavenly-bound train, God's word and truth drive the engine, and 'Repentance, Faith and Holiness' can all be found in first, second and third class respectively.

The ballad was to be sung 'To an Excellent Old Tune'.
This ballad is about a young woman overheard lamenting that she cannot find a husband 'for want of tocher-good'. In Scotland a 'tocher' was the bride's family's contribution to a marriage arrangement, and might consist of household items such as linen, silverware or crockery. A generous tocher would obviously be attractive to prospective suitors. When this ballad was written, a woman's social standing would have been governed her marital status, and spinsterhood was greatly feared by many women. The word 'tocher' is Scots, derived from Gaelic 'tochradh'.

Oddly enough the tune to the 'Sons of Levi', as it is normally known, has links with the earlier Jacobite song, 'Mo Ghile Mear'. Despite this origin the song was eventually inherited, from the Freemasons, by the Orange Lodge and is still part of their repertoire. The song is a description, in biblical terms, of a new member's initiation. Today, there is much controversy surrounding the origins of the Freemasons and it is curious to note that the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitallers are both mentioned here.

Ireland and Scotland shared a political fate - both of their national symbols had been or were under prohibition. In Scotland after the Jacobite rebellion (1746) tartan, bagpipes, thistles and so forth were all banned. In Ireland shamrocks and the wearing of green especially, were frowned upon as they represented nationalist sentiments. This song although not anti-unionist, is pro-Irish and Scottish, as it attributes England's success and pride to Scottish and Irish influences.

It was to be sung to the tune of 'Willie Winkies Farewell'. A 'coulter' was a piece of farm machinery and a 'nuting Tyne' was a nut-hook.
This clever comic song is a mock last will and testament. More than half the poem is taken up listing the late farmer's property and assets, before it is revealed 'And it was all for want of geer, That gart me steall the parlous Mare'. This implies that the farmer was probably hanged for stealing a horse in impoverished desperation. In a second irony, the final line reveals that the total value of the will is scarcely four Scots pounds.

There are other broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection which offer advice and scenarios to improve relationships and lifestyles.

Although this claims to be 'Widow MacFarlane's Lamentation for Her Son', it is highly unlikely that she actually wrote it. Broadside producers kept a keen eye on the market, and for particularly sensational or newsworthy crimes often produced a sequence of sheets covering every possible angle. Hans Smith MacFarlane and Helen Blackwood were executed in 1853, in Glasgow, for the murder of Alexander Boyd. Their case sparked a lot of interest and, as a result, received a great deal of coverage at the time.

This song was apparently sung at a wedding, but whether the 'widow' in the poem was meant to represent the new bride is unknown!

This ballad is narrated by a woman, who recalls her clandestine, implicitly sexual encounter with a young man named Finlay. The ballad subverts the stern prebyterian moral codes that prevailed in Scotland between the sixteenth and the nineteenth centuries. The narrator is no passive innocent or victim: not only does she recall the tryst with pleasure, but it is she who arranges it in the first place, having heard of Finlay's 'reputation'.

The chorus begins: 'Campbell is coming, Hurrah! Hurrah!' It was composed by John McLean, 'Coal-miner, and Poet Laureate to his Baccanalian Majesty', and includes a woodcut illustration of a mounted soldier.
There are many broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection that deal with the political tensions between the Tories, the Whigs and the Radicals in Edinburgh in the early 1830s. 'Campbell' is most likely the London-based lawyer and Whig, Sir John Campbell, who stood as a Parliamentary candidate for Edinburgh in the 1834, 1835 and 1837 . This song which concerns the 1834 election, not only calls on people to vote for Campbell, but also recognises 'Aytoun' as a suitable candidate. In this instance 'Aytoun' is most likely James Aytoun (1797-1881), a well-known member of the Radical Party in Edinburgh, who stood in the same election. The author of this piece, John McLean, does not appear to mind which of the two men people vote for, as long as their vote keeps the Tories out!

This sad ballad employs poetic imagery to tell the story of a small ship that was engulfed by a massive ocean wave, just as it was about to reach the safe haven of a nearby port. The language used to describe the temperamental sea conjures up an image of some almighty deity. This image is supported by the writer's earlier reference to 'the Grecian isles', a setting which fires the imagination with thoughts of Neptune and Proteus. The ballad is very much about man's helplessness and insignificance, when confronted with elements far more powerful than himself.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s.

Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

'Whistling Sannie' is a song about a boy or man who is loved by women for his whistling ability. He is favourably compared to different songbirds, which are all identified by their Scots names rather than the more familiar English ones. A 'laverock' is a lark, a 'linti' or 'lintie' is a linnet, and a 'mavis' is a thrush. 'Sannie' is also Scots, and is one of many abbreviations of Alexander.

The publication details of this broadside have been obscured.
The print quality of this broadside indicates that it is almost certainly from the nineteenth century, when Scotland's international profile was at its greatest. The romantic movement in the arts was interested in the picturesque and in the notion of the 'noble savage', and Scotland produced literature, in James Macpherson's 'Ossian' poems and Walter Scott's novels, that drew on the Highland landscape and Scottish clan history and mythology, making the authors international bestsellers. Simultaneously, Scotland was becoming a world leader in developing industrial technology. The ballad is thus justified in claiming that Scotland's fame lies in 'art', 'science' and 'romantic story'.

These lyrics would eventually turn into the ironic common saying 'Where did you get that hat'. The words themselves were re-written in 1901 by James Rolmaz. He gave them a more political twist with comments about society and the Prince of Wales being passed. The comic sentiments expressed in these lyrics would probably have been highly entertaining and instantly recognisable to most of  those in the audience.

In the writer's desire to show that earning the love of a good woman is the best possession that a man can attain in life, this broadside ballad contrasts the wonders of nature with worldly riches, to show that love triumphs over everything else. The author of this ballad was James Hogg (also known as the Ettrick Shepherd) who lived from 1770 to 1835. It was first published as 'The sweetest thing the best thing' in Hogg's novel The three perils of man (London, 1822)  and then revised as 'When the kye come hame' with music in Blackwood's Magazine in May 1823. Further revisions were made in 1831.It has been reprinted numerous times in collected editions of Hogg's works and also in other works.

This broadside carries no publication details.
'When Johnny Comes Marching Home' was written by Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore (1829-92). Gilmore was born in Ballygar, County Galway in Ireland. Apparently inspired by a British military band he had seen as a child, Gilmore learned how to play the trumpet and moved to Boston in the US, where his musical talents became renowned. 'When Johnny Comes Marching Home', about a soldier returning from war, was inspired by the Battle of Gettysburg, in July 1863, when the tide of the American Civil War began to turn in favour of the Union. The song was hugely popular and is still often heard today.

The song should be sung to an original tune and would have cost a penny to buy. It was published on Saturday morning, 27th November, 1869, by the Poet's Box of 80 London Street, Glasgow.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were.

This bawdy and light-hearted ballad describes the colourful social life led by the tinker doctor, William Mitchel. The adjective, 'Tincklarian', suggests that the doctor was probably a quack doctor, who sold potions and snake-oil medicines to unwary members of the public. It appears that the doctor was quite a ladies' man, and often entertained them at a location called the 'Bon-Head', most likely a public house. His existence as a single man-about-town ended, however, when Ann Stewart entered his life, and this momentous meeting eventually ended in the marriage of the ballad's title.

Included at the top of the sheet is a woodcut portrait of a young woman.
This rather saccharine ballad was intended to tug at the heartstrings of the broadside readership. Tales of woe involving neglected and abused children were common and probably sold well. In most cases the ballad ends with the death of the child and, as a result, an end to his or her suffering. The young girl in this ballad has been forced on to the streets to beg and steal by a man, who is very possibly her stepfather. Unable to do either, and unable to return home for fear of being beaten, the young girl eventually dies.

A note following the title states that this couple 'were married in Edinburgh, on the 13th of June 1718; their Ages One Hundred and Sixty years', and that the ballad should be sung to the tune, 'The old Woman poor and blind'.
Set in Edinburgh, this romantic ballad describes a marriage between a bridegroom aged 88, and a bride aged 72. After light-heartedly describing the physical decay that accompanies ageing, and the lovers' philosophical and stoical reaction to it, the ballad proceeds to the wedding ceremony of the two elderly lovers. Held at a church in Nidderie's Wynd, the ballad-writer describes the reception as quite a feast and gathering of many people. The ballad concludes on a thoughtful note, by asking young people to be kind, and to wish the old lovers many days together in their new state of married bliss.

' Below the title, it is recorded that this wedding song was to celebrate 'the marraige of John Brown, merchant in Holland, and Margaret Hepburn, daughter to the Laird of Bairfoot, solemnized 28 of July 1714'.
As suggested by the reference to Laird of Bairfoot (sic), this scurrilous ballad is not a proper wedding song at all, but is instead a savage criticism of a young bride who is leaving Edinburgh for Holland. Such is the contemptuous tone of the song, one would think it had been written by a rejected suitor. At a time (1714) when many colonial wars were being fought, it was customary in Britain to demonise foreign countries - regardless of the strong trade and cultural links that previously existed between Scotland and Holland. It was probably this feverish climate that inspired the writer to talk about Holland as a land where people with brown skins eat garlic, drink brandy 'And Eat their own Flesh when they Dine'.

A woodcut of a woman and man, apparently the worse for alcohol, adorns the top of the sheet. The subject matter dates the sheet to 1840.
This cheeky ballad celebrates Queen Victoria's (r. 1837-1901) wedding to Albert, whom the author derides as 'the German bit laird'. It seems, however, that the author wishes Victoria had married the Scot, Lord Elphinstone. Queen Victoria always loved Scotland and spent much of her time at Balmoral, which endeared her to her Scottish subjects, therefore to see a Scot as Prince Regent would have delighted them even more!

This ballad is a satire about a churchman who is prepared to change his religious allegiance to earn fame and fortune and to curry favour with whichever monarch and party are in power. The poet depicts the priest wondering 'Whether Jimmy or William he ought to obey', 'Jimmy' being the Catholic James VII of Scotland and II of England, and 'William' being the Protestant William of Orange, who succeeded the deposed James in 1688. The 'Vicar of Bray', also mentioned, is the hero of a similar satirical poem from about 1734, and the reference dates this poem to after that.

This lengthy ballad follows the tale of Watty and Meg, a husband and wife. It opens with Watty complaining to his friend Mungo about his wife's 'confounded girning'. Mungo suggests that he should call her bluff and threaten to leave, thereby silencing her once and for all! Watty follows this advice and the ballad ends with Meg pleading with him to stay and pledging never to scold him again. Presented entirely from Watty's perspective, it says nothing of the trials of having a drunken husband.
The author of 'Watty and Meg' is said to be the celebrated American ornithologist, Alexander Wilson (1766-1813). Born in Paisley, Scotland, Wilson left school at an early age to train as a weaver. He soon abandoned his apprenticeship to take up work as a pedlar and, inspired by the likes of Robert Burns, began to write his own poetry. After years of roving the countryside as a pedlar and working to survive, Wilson finally emigrated to America in the early 1790s.

Publishing three ballads on one sheet would have made this broadside much more attractive to potential purchasers.

Illustrated with a woodcut of Jacobite soldiers, this ballad is dedicated to Charles Edward Stewart, 'Bonnie Prince Charlie' (1720-88), as he flees the redcoats following the Battle of Culloden. The writer imagines the indignities inflicted upon the would-be king, as he is forced to sleep among the heather of the Highlands, and contrasts his current abode with the palace in which he should be residing. The bird that appears in the ballad could be a symbol for Prince Charlie, since 'the king o'er the water' was often referred to as various types of bird by supportive writers and poets who wished to avoid being denounced as Jacobite sympathisers.

It was to be sung 'to its own proper tune.'
'Valiant Jockie' is narrated by a woman whose husband has gone off to battle. She misses him so deeply that in verse one she resolves to disguise herself as a soldier and go to be with him as he fights. The remaining four verses develop the narrator's vision of her life as a soldier, and she describes herself as 'the nixt Dundee'. This is a reference to the Jacobite general John Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, who died in 1689, and thus we can probably date the poem to some time after that.

Although no publication details are included, the sheet was almost certainly published in 1859.
This commemorative poem was written to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Scotland's national bard, Robert Burns (1759-96). The author was probably Catherine Bacon (nee Mackay) who was from Falkirk. She lived from about 1815-1898. These verses were apparently read out at a celebratory dinner in Coatbridge on the anniversary of Burns' birthday. This event is what a modern-day audience would describe as 'Burns' Night'. Such nights are characterised by storytelling, the eating of haggis, the drinking of whisky, and the 'Immortal Toast' to the poet. It is interesting to see that such events were taking place as early as 1859, since 'Burns' Night' is regarded as a worldwide tradition that dates from the late nineteenth century.

Whilst there are many ballads, from the female perspective, which lament the departure of a loved one into battle, this ballad is sung by a woman who is not content to remain at home but, instead, wishes to fight alongside her 'dearest Jockey'. Whilst Jockey, in his reply, commends her bravery and loyalty, he pleads with her to stay at home. The ballad is set during the Battle of Killiecrankie (1689), when Viscount Dundee - 'Bonnie Dundee' - led Jacobite forces against supporters of William of Orange led by General Sir Hugh Mackay.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites. The term 'ballad' eventually applied more broadly to any kind of topical or popular verse.","Broadside ballad entitled 'Valiant Jockie, or The Maiden Warriour'",1700

This whimsical and dream-like ballad waxes lyrically about a journey to visit the man in the moon, travelling there by hot air balloon. It is likely that this light-hearted ballad was written for a child, given the playful - yet educational - tone of the verses. After telling us about all the exciting things he saw during his fantastic journey, the writer breaks the magical spell by suddenly revealing that the whole episode was merely a dream. Many broadside ballads such as this one are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

This political ballad clearly decries the corruption amongst the lawyers of Auld Reekie, and makes several references to the power they wield. Disillusionment with both the Whig and Tory parties is also highlighted, with a call instead to 'choose a man frae 'mang OUR AIN' as Edinburgh's parliamentary representative. This ballad is a parody of the traditional Jacobite song 'Up and Warn A', Wullie', which, according to Robert Burns, was the warning of a Highland clan to arms. It was referred to by Lowlanders as 'Up and Waur Them A', Willie', and this updated version could in a sense be viewed as a last-ditch political war cry!

In economically depressed Victorian times, it was common for parish boards to give the poor and destitute employment breaking stones. This was gruelling and arduous labour. The stones were used to fill potholes in parish-maintained roads. This well-written song highlights how demeaning it is for a skilled man to have to resort to this back-breaking and seemingly trivial work.
It is not clear whether the lyricist, John Wilson, is the famous poet, reviewer and essayist of the same name, who usually wrote under the pseudonym 'Christopher North'. He lived between 1785 and 1854, slightly before the Victorian depression although stone breaking would also have been carried on, to a lesser extent, in his day.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The Unemployed Breakin' Stanes',1880-1900

This song was written by John Barr of Glasgow. The sheet carries no publication details.
'The Unco Change' is a sequel to a ballad entitled 'The Drunkard's Raggit Wean', which painted a tragic picture of a child left threadbare, hungry and lonely by his drunken parents. 'The Drunkard's Raggit Wean' was reprinted many times and was also mentioned in other ballads, suggesting that it had had a powerful impact on its hearers. In 'The Unco Change', the author John Barr optimistically imagines the parents from the earlier poem joining the Temperance Movement, and giving their children the happy life they deserve.

This sheet was published by John Barr of Glasgow. 'Unco' is used in various ways by the Scots language but this context is conveys a sense of extreme and unfamiliar change.
John Barr worked in Glasgow as a lithographer, engraver and printer between 1841 and 1866. He moved premises five or six times in that period and twice worked with partners. Broadside production was best suited to unlicensed and uncommissioned printers as the constant turn-over in trade made up for the deficit in lucrative contracts. It is more unusual to find a printer, with such a range of skills and therefore presumably working further up the market, producing these ephemeral and cheap sheets.

The song was originally performed by W.H. Lanegan, but no date for its composition is given. The broadside was published by William Shepherd at the Poet?s Box, 182 Overgate, Dundee. It is notable for more spelling and typographical errors than usual.
This a comic ballad describing the eponymous Uncle Will's annual pilgrimage from the countryside into Glasgow, to buy toys for his nieces and nephews. Uncle Will, who narrates the ballad, is portayed very much as an innocent abroad, and between the verses of the ballad there are spoken interludes where he describes his various adventures and mishaps at the hands of the more streetwise inhabitants of Glasgow. This structure of alternating sung and spoken sections is quite common in broadside ballads, and emphasises the fact that these were very much pieces intended for public performance, on the street, in pubs or in music halls.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

A woodcut illustration has been included at the top of the sheet showing four scantily-clad figures in a clearing. There are no publication details given, but this is one of two songs - printed by James Lindsay - on this sheet. 
This song is based on the character of Uncle Tom, taken from Harriet Beecher Stowe's famous and controverisal book, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' (1852). Although Beecher Stowe has since been criticised for her patronising portrayal of black Americans, the publication of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' helped to advance the anti-slavery cause greatly. This particular broadside ends on a rousing note asking the question, 'Shall he who is but man himself, / Enslave his fellow man? / Then all united be, / To give to each other a brother's hand, / And set the black man free.'

This broadside was published on Saturday, 12th August 1871 and priced at one penny. The publisher was the Poet's Box. The city of publication has been obscured but can be made out as Glasgow.
'Trust to Luck' is a song designed to raise the morale of its audience, encouraging people to remain open, positive and to 'stare fate in the face'. The song has similar sentiments to songs that became popular during the First World War, such as 'Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag' or 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary'. Like the latter song, 'Trust to Luck' probably originated in music halls, which were the most popular sources of entertainment in Britain in the late nineteenth century.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets.

The first eight lines of this ballad also feature as a verse in the popular Scots song 'Auld Lang Syne'. There are many versions of 'Auld Lang Syne' and most poets during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries wrote their own version of it. The origin of the tune is also obscured by the oral culture in which it is embedded. As a result it is a little difficult to give this poem, with its negative extension on the loss of Scottish Independence, any concrete context.

The second ballad begins: 'Saw ye Johnnie comin, quo she, / Johnnie Russell comin ; / The Reform Bill in his hand, / And a' the Tories rinnin, quo she, / And a' the Tories rinnin?' The text preceding this reads: 'Dedicated to the Reform Committee of Dalkeith in honour of the triumph of Reform.' The woodcut at the top of the column seems to be of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.
This two songs have the theme of reform in common which is often associated with the Whig Party. The official Reform Act was eventually passed in 1832 and it increased Britain's voters from 6% to 12% of the total population. Broadsides were often sold with two songs on the same sheet. This would have seemed like better value for money as the sheet would still have sold for a penny, increasing its potential market value and making it a more attractive purchase.",Broadside ballads entitled 'The Triumph of Reform' and 'A New Song',1832

Taylor of Lochwinnoch and is dated the 3rd February, 1821.
Little is known about the publisher William Taylor, other than that he was a teacher as well as a printer and had premises at Calder Street, Lochwinnoch, between 1831 and 1834. It was typical of broadside producers to publish material that was of local interest for the local market. In this instance, Taylor has printed this rather touching tribute to a stranger who was brutally murdered in the parish of Lochwinnoch. It appears that the identity of the victim continued to remain a mystery after his death.

'Traveller's Return' is narrated by a traveller who revisits his home after an estrangement of thirty years, and finds that all but one of his former friends has died. Travel and separation were two of the most common themes in broadside ballads. Often travellers were portrayed as romantic figures, but frequently the adventure and excitement of travelling was balanced, as in this case, with the idea that there is no place like home. In other ballads, reflecting historical reality in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, men might be forced to travel or emigrate to find work, or to join the armed forces, leaving their young families behind.

This cutting ballad was written sometime after the Battle of Culloden in 1746. It savagely criticises the Jacobites and their supporters, and praises King George II and his son, the Duke of Cumberland, for their efforts to restore 'a flourishing peace' between Scotland and England. The Swiss, French, Danish, German and early American revolutionary, James Oglethorpe are also lambasted for their rebelliousness. Because of the overall tone of the piece, and the fact that it refers to, 'the Scots . . . (For ever betraying, for ever betray'd)', it is likely that this was not composed by a Scot.

Although it is not attributed on the broadside, this poem was written by Caroline Norton (1808-77). Norton was the granddaughter of playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751-1816). Her first published poetry appeared in 1829 and as a result she became a successful magazine editor. She found further fame as a political poet and pamphleteer, but also a certain amount of notoriety when it was alleged that she had been having an affair with the Whig Home Secretary Lord Melbourne. The claims were made by Norton's husband, a Tory who was known to be violent toward her. Norton's unhappy marriage influenced her political activism, which contributed to the Marriage and Law Act of 1857.

The song also goes by the titles 'The Lads who Live in Ireland' and 'Where the Apple Praties Grow', and sometimes the main character 'Ted' can be found as 'Ned'. This song was later claimed by James Seymour as his composition but this is difficult to verify. The word 'praties' is transliterated Irish  'pratai' or potato.

'Annie Laurie' was a popular song, and James Lindsay is known to have published it on several different occasions.
Throughout the years there has been some doubt over the origins of this well-loved song. Whilst some believe it to be the work of William Douglas of Fingland, it has been suggested that it was written by Allen Cunningham. The well-known tune that is associated with the song was written in the nineteenth century by Lady John Scott (Alicia Ann Spottiswood) - who is also said to have adapted the words.

This broadside combines two of the most common broadside features: details of the crime and a poem about it. This combination of compelling entertainment would probably have been well-received by an audience lacking more technologically advanced inventions. As a result it was also an opportunity for the author to lecture the public on morals and the consequences of thoughtless actions.
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers. Crimes could generate sequences of sheets covering descriptive accounts, court proceedings, last words, lamentations and executions as they occurred.

'The Whig's o' Fife' was and still is a fairly popular folksong, and the East Neuk of Fife had a reputation as a Whig stronghold. The 'Sir Thomas Dick Lauder' (1784-1848) referred to in the text was a famous author, publishing many books on the history of Scotland especially, and he was a renowned Whig politician. This particular sheet, however, seems to be a criticism of the disparity of being Scottish and a Scottish politician, but living and participating in London's political life. A further example of popular criticism of the Union of Parliaments.

The sculpture was based on Alexander Wilson's (1766-1813) popular poem of 1792, 'Watty and Meg', which is reproduced in full on the page. The press reviews praise Anderson's sculpture highly, and describe it as a group of figures from the poem, carved from a single block of stone. It appears to have been exhibited in Dundee.

This ballad is a satire on Tom Burnett, a Whig parliamentary candidate for the Mearns, south of Aberdeen. The verse form and imagery are a parody of Lord Byron's poem 'The Destruction of Sennacherib'. The introduction reveals that the idea for the parody came from John Wilson or 'Christopher North', editor of Blackwood's Magazine, who had composed a similar parody satirising a political candidate for Leith. It is a fitting coincidence that Byron was a native of Aberdeenshire.

The two ballads on this broadside are quite different in tone. 'Allen and Sally' is a song about a wife failing to recognise her husband on his return from battle because he has been so altered by his experiences. 'Banks of Clyde' appears at first to be a romantic song, but in fact culminates in a very cruel, darkly humorous manner, with the narrator seducing the girl he has enchanted and then abandoning her with false promises of future meetings.

16290,ballad,L.C.1269(177a),"This ballad begins: 'Oh, had I but Aladdin's Lamp, / If only for a day, / I'd try to find a link to bind / The joys that pass away. / I'd try to bring an angel's wing / Upon this earth again, / And build true worth home on earth, / A home beloved by men.' A note below the title states that 'This deservedly popular song created a great sensation in this city some months ago, when intsoduced to the Glasgow public by that admirable singer, Mr Plumpton'. The sheet was published on the Saturday morning of January 26th, 1856, and was available for purchase from the Poet's Box.
The writer of this whimsically altruistic ballad muses on what he would do to improve the world, if he had his own Aladdin's Lamp. The legend of Aladdin's Lamp is one of the most famous stories from the Tales of the Arabian Nights. In the original story, the lamp is rubbed and a genie suddenly emerges from the lamp to grant the lamp's owner three magic wishes. As the writer's stated objective is to end poverty through creating a utopia and brotherhood of man, it could be argued that this ballad is quite political in subject matter.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

This ballad was to be sung to an 'Original' tune and could be bought for one penny. It was published on 16th April 1870 by the Poet's Box, probably in Glasgow.
This narrator of this song is supposed to be an African-American slave who has come to England to make his fortune. Slave-ownership in Britain was legally abolished in 1772, ninety-three years before it was ended in the United States, although British involvement in the Atlantic slave trade continued until 1807. The impression given here of Britain treating all races equally probably bore little resemblance to the real experiences of black people in Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Suspicion and prejudice born of ignorance were still common in a Great Britain with far less ethnic variation than today, although many Britons had been active in campaigning against slavery.

Written in a highly erudite and lofty style, this ballad celebrates the achievements of the late Robert Montgomery, who was Lord Provost of Edinburgh during the mid-eighteenth century. In this eulogy, the writer depicts Montgomery as a virtual saviour, who turned Edinburgh from a den of godless wickedness into the modern 'Athens of the North' - which is Edinburgh's nickname. It was certainly during this mid-century period that architects such as John Adams, designed and built many of Edinburgh's finest buildings. After singing his praises, the writer concludes by saying that all the citizens of Edinburgh send out their love to the recently departed Lord Provost.

This broadside was priced at one penny and was published on Saturday, 19th September 1857 by the Poet's Box. The town of publication has been obscured, but was probably Glasgow.
Ballads about or narrated by travellers, sailors and soldiers were very commonplace on broadsides. Their popularity probably stemmed from the romantic connotations of exploration and seeing new worlds, especially in circumstances where there was an element of danger. In the nineteenth century, when this broadside was published, the opportunities for people to travel were far fewer, and much more difficult, than today.

The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills.

A note below the title states that the ballad should be sung to the tune, 'the Arethusa', which is a traditional Scottish song dating from around 1730, and also the name of a poem by the radical poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley. Although there are no publication details included on this sheet, the reference to Jamie Aytoun suggests that it was most likely published in Edinburgh during the 1830s.
Illustrated with a woodcut of a gentleman riding his horse, this ballad champions the political aims of Lord James Abercrombie (1776-1858). MP for Edinburgh from 1832-9, Lord Abercrombie was also the Speaker of the House of Commons from 1835-9. Judging by what the author says of Abercrombie, he would have been a member of the Whig Party, who were in power at this time. Apparently, there was a fear that Jamie Aytoun's candidature would split the Whig vote, hence the writer's mild criticism of Aytoun (1797-1881) and the Reformers. Lord Abercrombie was created Baron Dunfermline in 1839.

This ballad was 'Sung with great success by Walter Munro', printed by William Shepherd, at the Poet?s Box, 182 Overgate, Dundee.
The battle of the sexes was a common theme in broadside ballads. In this example, as in many others, the ballad is designed to elict sympathy for the rather pathetic male narrator, and the descriptions of the 'fine big woman' of the title are quite misogynistic. However, women historically had a more active role in writing and performing ballads than in most other areas of composition, and this is reflected in the fact that there is quite a number of ballads in the National Library of Scotland's collection that describe a woman's situation from a woman's perspective, and in some cases challenge society's paternalistic morality.

'Dandy Husband' is a comic poem narrated by a woman verbally attacking her husband. 'Old Mill Stream' laments the decay of favorite childhood place, whilst 'Braes o' Gleniffer' is a well known song by the accomplished Paisley poet Robert Tannahill (1774-1810).

Set outside Lord Ely's Gates at Rathfarnham Castle, near Dublin, this darkly humorous ballad tells the story of a travelling man who receives help from a friendly landlady, in order to escape a gang of armed men. The man had earlier met a pretty maid who works as a nurse for Lord Ely, and the pair had arranged a rendezvous at a nearby tavern, so that the man could somehow provide the young woman with a sight of her true love, Johnny. Upon looking out the tavern window, however, he sees a gang of armed men heading towards him instead of his true love. A rather difficult to understand ballad, it could be that the writer is referring to a famous murder that occurred in this very spot in 1841.

Another note, this time located at the bottom of the sheet, states it was published on the Saturday morning of 11th July 1857.
This ballad is quite unusual, in that it contains detailed information regarding how the song should be sung. Indeed, the introduction of 'Ladies and Gentlemen', combined with the preferred musical key advice for the accompanying pianist, is the type of light-hearted banter that one would expect of a music hall performance. The ballad itself tells of a terrible storm that sank a ship upon leaving Bublin Bay - 'Bublin' probably being a pun on 'bubbling', as the location is Dublin Bay. Lyrical in its use of poetic language, the ballad was written during the turbulent era when many Scottish and Irish people were leaving their old homes and emigrating to locations such as the 'New World'.

This ballad is narrated by Betsy, one of the Duke of Gordon's servants, who is seduced by a sea captain. When she falls pregnant, her fellow staff, and even the Duchess of Gordon herself, suspect that the Duke is the father, until Betsy admits who the father is. Many ballads written were condemning illegitimate pregnancy, but others took a more lenient view and recognised that love and desire were not necessarily impure feelings outside marriage. 'Captain Glen' is in the latter category, but the ballad ends respectably with the captain returning to marry his Betsy.

It was to be sung to the old Scottish air 'The Campbells are Coming', was published on 13th January 1855, by the Poet's Box, Glasgow, and was priced at one penny.
This ballad was clearly intended for performance, as the text beneath the title confirms: 'This fine song is sung, with the most unbounded applause, by that comical of all comic singers, Mr Charles Watson, in the Shskspeare Saloon, Glasgow. The rapturous encores, with which he is nightly greeted show how much he is loved by those who appreciate the Muse, and admire original talent of a high character. Now that the Lancashire Militia has arrived in Glasgow, on the 11th instant, the Poet expects a great run to the box for this funny song'.

The first song exhibits strong Jacobite leanings as tartan was illegal in Scotland until the visit of George IV in 1822 and any mention of Prince Charles Edward Stuart was treason after 1746. The second song was popular on broadsides and similarities can be found in 'The Young Sailor Lad' and 'If I was a Blackbird'.

There are many poems contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection which address the topic of country lads being duped by loose con women. This does seem to have been a concern amongst eighteenth- and nineteenth-century societies. There are other broadsides held, which describe the colourful Briggate in more detail. Undressed, gossiping, tipsy women seem to feature quite heavily.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

This particular three-verse song was 'Written and composed by ROBERT CARMICHAEL, Lundin Mill, near Largo, Fifeshire.'
A note under the title informs the reader that the verses were intended to be sung to the air, 'Roslin Castle'. With no accompanying music, the tune was most probably well-known amongst the readership. This particular song deals with pastoral themes that would have particularly appealed to a growing urban population. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution many people were forced to leave behind their rural existence and forge a new life in the rapidly expanding towns. Although rural life was far from idyllic, many new urbanites harked back to a romanticised version of the 'old life'.

Broadsides, particularly those describing criminal cases, were often written to reinforce the stern presbyterian morality that prevailed in Scottish society between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. This ballad is unusual in that it does quite the reverse. It is narrated by a woman who allows her sweetheart to make love to her although they are not married. Instead of expressing regret, or being punished, she argues that the experience has strengthened their love and asks 'where's the Hurt of this?'

Admiral Viscount Adam Duncan (1731-1804), born in Dundee, was eventually created Baron Duncan of Lundie to celebrate his efforts. Duncan was in charge of the British blockade of the North Sea, in 1797, when he met the Dutch fleet, off the village of Kampen, with eighteen ships. Eleven of the Dutch ships, all under the Command of Admiral de Winter, were taken. The struggle became known as the Battle of Camperdown and it relieved the threat of invasion.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day.

It is most unusual for a Poet's Box publication to have an author attached. These publications were quick and cheap and as a result mainly anonymous. Although the name Harry Wall is given there is very little known about Wall or his entertainment business. It is unusual also to find a copyright statement of sorts on a broadside. Copyright issues were not fully addressed until well into the twentieth century.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

William Mackintosh was born in 1658 the son of William Mackintosh and Mary Baillie of Dunain. The family home was based in the estates at Borlum, Inverness-shire - 'of Borlum' eventually becoming the family suffix. William married Mary Reade of whom little is known and they had two sons, Benjamin and Lachlan. The Mackintoshes were declared Jacobite supporters. William and his cousin Lachlan led 800 of their clansmen at the battle of Preston (1715), where they were routed. Many men were taken and transported to America, but William managed to escape to France in 1716. Although he died there in 1743, his children remained in Scotland.

Brigadier William Mackintosh was a Jacobite rebel who, together with his cousin Lachlan, led 800 clansmen at the disastrous Battle of Preston in November 1715. Many of those captured were transported to America, but William managed to escape to France in 1716. There are other copies of this poem held in the National Library of Scotland's collection, suggesting that this pro-Jacobite song was popular.

It was advertised as a new song and includes a woodcut illustration of a small leprechaun-like figure reading a book.
This moralising ballad recounts the tragic tale of a young woman called Jane, who meets and falls in love with a wealthy man who promises to marry her. Upon this pledge, she becomes his lover and soon becomes pregnant. Only when he callously disowns her and the unborn child, does she discover his true nature. Unable to cope, Jane tragically takes her own life. The theme of misguided love that ultimately ends in tragedy is a familiar one in broadside ballads, and many examples can be found in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

The ballad is sung to the tune of 'Sheriff-Moor' and begins: 'NOW if you'l but stay, I'll tell you the Way, / It's how the Bridgeroom ran awa-- Man'.
The ballad follows the tale of a bridegroom who abandons his bride on their wedding night. Believing himself to have been duped into marrying a penniless bride, he refuses to consummate the marriage and leaves her. This was particularly important since an annulment could be obtained if the marriage was unconsummated. This fast-paced romp appears on another broadside in the National Library of Scotland's collection, decorated with two woodcut illustrations.

The 93rd Sutherland Highlanders were raised in 1799, and existed for almost 100 years until 1881 when they were amalgamated with the 91st. Always the most Highland of regiments, they were even put into companies with men from their home parish. The ballad mentions Sir Colin Campbell, Lord Clyde (1792-1863) and the regiment's successes at Alma (September 1854) and Lucknow (November 1857).

A note below the title states that this ballad was to be sung to an original tune. Sold for a penny, a further note below the title states that 'Copies can always be had in the Poet's Box, 80 London Street, Glasgow'. Strangely, however, to the left of this scored-out Glasgow address, the address of the Poet's Box in Dundee has been stamped on the sheet. A footnote affirms that the sheet was published on Saturday the 2nd of July, 1870.
This well-known ballad goes under a number of alternative titles and variants, while the story at the heart of the song has been investigated and written about by James Hogg and Sir Walter Scott. In short, the ballad tells the tragic tale of some brothers who, disapproving of their sister's fiance, murder the unfortunate suitor. The sister dreams that she and her lover are together in Yarrow (near Selkirk), picking green heather. This dream is supposed to symbolise the death of her lover. Sir Walter Scott's theory that the ballad is based on a duel between John Scott of Tushielaw and his brother-in-law, Walter Scott of Thirlestane, is the interpretation favoured by the collector and publisher of ballads, Francis J. Child.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were.

It was published by J. Pitts of Great St Andrew Street, London, and includes a woodcut illustration of a well-dressed man standing next to a window.
The inclusion of a woodcut illustration on this sheet would probably have helped to boost sales. Although the price of a broadside was usually no more than one penny, the broadside-buying public were more inclined to buy a sheet that featured a picture, believing it to be better value. The publishers were fully aware of this and maintained an often limited stock of woodcuts that could be used across a range of different sheets. People appeared unconcerned if the illustration provided bore little or no relation to the topic.

The sheet was published by Harkness of Church Street in Preston. The author of 'The Braes o' Gleniffer' is given as Tannahill.
'The Braes o' Gleniffer' is the best known song written by the weaver and poet Robert Tannahill (1774-1810). It was inspired by Gleniffer Braes in Renfrewshire, overlooking Tannahill's home town of Paisley. 'Henry and Nancy' is a song about a young man exchanging farewells with his sweetheart before he joins the navy. Songs that involved two lovers forced apart by financial circumstances or by military duty were among the most common types of ballad featured on broadsides.

The woodcut at the top of this sheet is unusually detailed and expressive for broadside publications. A uniformed man is kneeling at the feet of a well-dressed and veiled woman, both characters appear to be in emotional turmoil.
The Highland lad of the song pleads with this beautiful lass to uproot and go north. He offers to marry her, keep her safe and happy, and give her a good place in society - unusually honest and open sentiments expressed, by a man, in a broadside publication. Although at first hesitant, mainly because of the heartbreak her parents would feel, she eventually agrees. This sheet offers a brief insight into the Scottish migration around the country and the reasons for it.

14992,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(60b),"Verse 1: 'Cheer up, cheer up, my mother dear, / O, why do you sit and weep? / Do you think that He who guides me here / Forsakes me on the deep? / Let hope and faith illume glance / That sees the bark set sail; / Look, look at her now and see her dance. / O, why do you turn so pale? / 'Tis an English ship and an English crew, / So mother be proud of your boy in blue.'
This song a version of 'The song of the sailor boy' written by Eliza Cook (1818-1889) is narrated by a young sailor reassuring his mother, whom he imagines is at home weeping over him. Ballads about servicemen and travellers were popular. The elements of danger and of seeing new world evoked by such songs probably held romantic appeal for many people. The line ''Tis an English ship and an English crew' suggests that the song originated in England, but the illustration, showing Glasgow's coat-of-arms, indicates that this broadside version may have been printed in Glagsow.

This ballad is written from the viewpoint of a conscientious Scottish sailor far from home, who wants to reassure his angst-ridden mother not to worry about him. Indeed, the ballad mentions that it is unlikely that God, who looks after him so successfully on land, should forsake her son when he is aboard a ship. Accompanying the text, is a woodcut of a sailor dancing what looks like the Highland fling. Many broadside ballads such as this one are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

A note below the title states that the ballad should be sung to the air, 'Duncan Gray'. Although there are no publication details included on this sheet, the political context referred to suggests that it was most likely published in Edinburgh during the 1830s.
This irreverent broadside almost certainly relates to a political contest that took place in Edinburgh during the 1830s - hence the writer's frequent references to political 'wooing'. Unfortunately, however, the people mentioned in this ballad are not particularly well known figures, so it is difficult to place the broadside in its exact historical context. It is possible, however, that the Whig politician called 'Bottom' is a contemptuous allusion to the famous Edinburgh lawyer, writer and publisher, Henry Brougham (1778-1868). The National Library of Scotland's collection contains numerous political broadsides that report on elections in Edinburgh during the 1830s and 1840s.

The second ballad begins: 'Row well, my boatie, row weel, / Row weel my merry men a'!' A woodcut of two well wrapped up men in a boat, at what appears to be night, has been included above the title.
Both poems refer to rural and traditional vocations but this appears to be their only connection. This, however, would probably have mattered little to the target market. The idea would have been that two songs on a sheet, for the same cost, was better value for money.

James Lindsay is known to have worked out of 11 King Street between 1860 and 1890, although he operated a printers shop in Glasgow from the 1840s through to 1908. By including a woodcut on the sheet, Lindsay probably hoped to increase its perceived value. Woodcuts, by this later time, were more sophisticated with clear and more lifelike detail. They were, however, still used generically and it would not be surprising to find this illustration on another unrelated sheet. This song was written by two Englishmen probably around 1850. 'Bonny Mary' was Robert Burns's 'Highland Mary' (Mary Campbell, 1763-1786), who died tragically young. It is thought that Burns had asked her to go to Jamaica with him, but she died before the voyage.

It was printed by T. Birt of Great St Andrew Street, London, and includes an advertisement.
Whilst this song relies heavily on the familiar and highly formulaic theme of tragic love found in so many traditional ballads, it does possess a poignancy that others often do not. The narrator upon retiring to bed one night overhears a young woman confiding her woes to the moon. Her grief and hopelessness are very real and combine with the poetic imagery to make this rather unassuming ballad quite memorable.

A woodcut of a woman walking along a country lane carrying a basket in each arm and a birdcage on her head, decorates the top of the sheet.
This traditional love song is typical of the type of material published as broadsides. James Lindsay was a prolific publisher and the number 40 at the bottom of the sheet suggests that this was part of a collectable sequence - a shrewd marketing move. Not wanting to waste any space on the sheet, at the bottom Lindsay also advertises the services his business provides, which are 'every description of Letterpress Printing . . . Lithography, Bookbinding &c.  &c.'

'Branksome' is a reference to Branxholme in Roxburghshire, the ancestral home of the Scotts of Buccleuch, 3 miles south of Hawick. 'Branksome' was also used as a literary motif during the early 1700s. The title of this song features in Allan Ramsay's (1686-1757) pastoral play 'The Gentle Shepherd' (1725) and the song was published in 1733 in William Thomson's 'Orpheus Caledonia'. It is an interesting reflection of eighteenth century attitudes to love and courtship. The song was traditionally said to have been written by 'Auld Hobbie o' Skelfhill'.

The two woodcuts on this page would have made the sheet more attractive to purchasers, especially as the sheet was bought for group perusal and not everyone would have been literate. Woodcuts are visual rhetoric and use instantly recognisable symbols. Here the man and woman suggest it is a love or courtship song. The girl is standing in an apron amongst foliage implying perhaps a rural setting. The gentleman wears a splendid frock and wig representing his social standing and wealth. These themes are all then reflected in the verses.

The phrase 'A New Song' was included to try and make this ballad seem like a more attractive purchase. This is also true of woodcuts included along the top of the plain page. Woodcuts were expensive to produce and so they were often reused on a number of sheets. Broadsides were sold in vast numbers by pedlars on the street and as a result competition was fierce.

The title of this ballad is intriguing. It is the same, although differently spelled, as one of the most famous of all Scots ballads, 'Bonnie Dundee'. The contents of the two ballads could not be more different, however. 'Bonny Dundee' appears to be a dialogue between two lovers who have become temporarily estranged, whilst 'Bonnie Dundee' is a celebration of the Jacobite general John Graham of Claverhouse (1648-1689). It may be that 'Bonny Dundee' was so named because it is intended to be sung to the same melody as its more famous counterpart.

This song belongs to Scotland's oral folk-tradition and as such very little is known about its origins. Collecting folk songs during the 1780s, Burns recorded in personal notes, that the first two lines of the song were fragmentary and the rest was written by James Tytler. He is known to have been a printer and involved in piece-work for the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica'. There is a tune with the same title, first recorded in the Leyden Manuscript of 1692.

This song was supplied by the Poet's Box. The town or city is not specified, but it was probably published in Dundee.
This comic ballad is narrated by a man whose greatest ambition in life is to marry an Aberdonian. The narrator seems proud of his careful, conservative outlook, criticising those who drink beer and claiming that his greatest joys are 'a bonny young lass and a gude cup o' tea'. Although the place of publication is not identified on this broadside, it seem likely that it did originate in north-east Scotland. The expression 'loonie', meaning 'boy' or 'man' and the pronounciation 'dee' for English 'do', are both markers of north-eastern Scots.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

This song, believed to be a traditional English folksong, can also often be found under the title 'The Sweet Primroses' or 'The Sweet Primeroses'. It was a popular tune amongst broadside publishers, possibly because its neutral content had a wide appeal. It eventually became very popular in America and has since been included in many American collections of family song books.

'Banks of Sweet Dundee' was a very popular song in the mid to late nineteenth century, and also goes by the title 'Undaunted Mary'. Different versions of the song were published in chapbooks and broadsides.

Judging by the woodcut of a rural worker that accompanies this broadside ballad, these verses might well be referring to the dying of the light for 'the Heaven-taught ploughman', Robert Burns. Certainly, the dark references to the 'gloomy night' and symbolic seasonal change from autumn to winter, hint at impending death. In addition to the Ayrshire setting, this ballad also appears in the middle of a sequence of broadsides dedicated to the immortal memory of Robert Burns. Many broadside ballads such as this one are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

The words were written by Robert Burns.
'The Fairest Flower' begins: 'The rose, diffusing sweet perfume, / Blooms bonny on its thorny tree; / The linnet sits amang the broom, / And charms us with its melody. / But ne'er was flower in field or bower, / Nor warbler on the greenwood tree, / That bloomed so bonnie in their hour, / Or sang more sweetly, love, than thee.' The words were written by P. McNeill, and the song was to be sung to the tune 'The Bonnie Woods of Craigielea'.
The publisher of this broadside possibly chose to group these two songs together because he saw the influence of one upon the other. 'Banks of Doon', first published in the 'Scots Musical Museum' in 1792 is one of Burns's most famous and popular songs. 'The Fairest Flower' takes as its central image the rose 'on its thorny tree' that also appears in Burns's song, However, in McNeill's version, the rose is a symbol of love and hope, whereas in Burns's bittersweet words the rose comes to represent betrayal.",Broadside ballads entitled 'Banks of Doon' and 'The Fairest Flower',1870-1890

This version of the 'Banks O' Tyne' was written by P. McNeill and probably sold at the Poet's Box, Dundee for one penny.
Although this broadside does not include a date, it was most likely published in the late nineteenth century. A first version of this song was published in 'The battle of Preston, Gaffer Gray or Knox and his times and other poems and songs' written by P. M'Neill of Tranent. This was probably Peter McNeill (1839-1929) who wrote a number of works on the East Lothian area. The River Tyne in question relates to the river which flows through Haddington and enters the sea at Dunbar.

This poem is attributed to 'his Royal Highness J.D.A.' and was to be sung 'to the tune of 'The Last Good-night'.
In 'The Banishment of Povertie' the narrator describes, in vigorous Scots, his odyssey through Scotland as he attempts to escape the clutches of poverty. It is significant that his journey starts in Kilbarchan: this is a tribute to 'The life and death of Habbie Simpson, Piper in Kilbarchan', one of the most popular and reprinted of all Scots ballads, which was written by Robert Sempill of Beltrees (1595?-1665?). 'The Banishment of Povertie' is believed to have been written by Robert's son, Francis Sempill (1616-1682), despite the attribution on the broadside. It is written in 'French octave', where the end-rhyme scheme is ABABBCBC, and the metre is iambic tetrameter.

15075,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(104a),"This ballad begins: 'There's a dashing sort of boy, who is called his mothes joy, / For his rucetion and elements they charm me; / He takes the chief command in a water-drinking land, / Called the Ballyhooly Blue ribbon Army.' It was published at 192 Overgate Dundee, probably by the Poet's Box.
'Ballyhooly' is a song narrated by a member of an organistion called the Ballyhooly Blue Ribbon, which seems to be a temperance movement. Such movements grew popular in Britain, Ireland and the United States during the nineteenth century. The author of this song seems to be implying, however, that once out of the sight of the commander, the members of the Blue Ribbon enjoy a sly drink. Ballyhooly is a village in County Cork, and the song does seem to be named after a real organisation. It is also referred to in James Joyce's novel 'Ulysses'. The song was probably composed by Robert Martin, also known as 'Ballyhooly Bob' who wrote a number of burlesque tunes for the London theatre in the 1880s and 1890s. He owned a large estate in Co. Galway and was the elder brother of Violet Martin more famous as ?Martin Ross? of the literary cousins ?Somerville & Ross?, who wrote 'Memories of an Irish R.M.' and other stories.

The ballad was to be sung to the tune of 'The Bonnets o' Bonnie Dundee'. The broadside was published in Dundee in November 1904. It carries the name 'Alvan Marlaw', but it is unclear whether this is the name of the author or of the publisher.
This broadside is a pastiche of the song 'Bonny Dundee' by Sir Water Scott (1771-1832). Whereas Scott's song is a romantic celebration of the Jacobite general John Graham of Claverhouse, this poem is an attack on corruption in Dundee's burgh council. In particular, the provost, or head of the council, is lampooned for being a tax-dodger, and a bully to the ordinary working man. In the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, broadside ballads increasingly served as expressions of radical and working class disenchantment with the social order.

There is no contextual information given in the original publication, but someone has purposely collected the sheet and commented on the content.

It was advertised as a new song and was to be sung to the tune of 'Arethusa'. A coat of arms with the motto, 'without fear and without reproach', adorns the top of the sheet.
The 'Aytoun' of the title was most likely Kirkcaldy-born manufacturer and Chartist, James Aytoun (1797-1881). In the mid-nineteenth century, Aytoun, a prominent Radical, stood for election as member of parliament for Edinburgh. The author of this piece is urging people to vote for him in the upcoming elections. 'Jeffrey' probably refers to the Whig politician Francis Jeffrey, (1733-1850) who was first elected as MP for Edinburgh in 1832. The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection includes a large number of ballads outlining the tensions between the Tories, Whigs and Radicals in mid-nineteenth-century Scotland.

Highlighting the bagpipes as an instrument of torture, John Couper's erudite and light-hearted ballad controversially claims that English culture and poesy is far superior to anything that the Scots can produce. Comparing John Dryden to Allan Ramsay, Couper, who studied poetry at Oxford, states that Scottish poets and musicians can only produce cacophonous sounds that torture the listener's poor ears. Feelings were running very high on both sides of the border after the Union of 1707, particularly following the nearly successful Jacobite Rebellion of 1715, and the ballad should properly be viewed in this context.

A note below the title states that this song should be sung to the tune, 'Mr Orator Puff'. Unfortunately, no publication details are included on the sheet, though it was probably published in the 1830s.
With its references to Whigs and Tories, it is clear that this is a political ballad. Irreverent and satirical in tone, the writer spotlights the hypocritical and corrupt nature of James Aytoun, (1797-1881) whom it accuses of masquerading as a Whig. In targeting Lord Castlereagh and the yeomanry for their collusion, the author is perhaps alluding to the slaughters of protesting Radicals at Peterloo (1819) and Bonnymuir (1820). James Aytoun was a prominent Radical politician in Edinburgh in the 1830s.
The National Library of Scotland holds another ballad relating to this incident,  entitled 'Mr Aytoun's Campaign Against the Airdrie Radicals'.","Broadside ballad entitled 'Aytoun the Yeoman!, or, The Orator Left in the Lurch by one of his Own Voters'",1830-1840

Although there are no publication details included on this sheet, the reference to Jamie Aytoun suggests that it was most likely published in Edinburgh during the 1830s.
Illustrated with a woodcut of a noble-looking and windswept Highlander, this political broadside celebrates the political virtues of James Aytoun (1797-1881). A member of the Radical Party, Aytoun unsuccessfully stood for election in Edinburgh during the 1830s and early 1840s.
In his criticism of the Whig Party, the author reveals much about the re-drawing of political boundaries that took place during this turbulent period. For although the 1830s are considered an age when reform took place, many people felt that the reforms did not go far enough and that the Whigs were virtually the same as the Tories. The National Library of Scotland's collection contains many broadsides that report on Aytoun's attempts to be elected as MP for Edinburgh.",Broadside ballad entitled 'Aytoun the Union Laddie',1830-1840

A note below the title states that 'Copies of this Recitation can always be had at the Poet's Box, 10 Hunter Street, Dundee', and that the sheet cost one penny. Unfortunately, the sheet is not dated.
This light-hearted ballad pokes fun at a minister who mistakes a sleeve of an old shirt for a napkin or fancy handkerchief. The ballad then moves into the setting of the pulpit, where the minister gives a fire and brimstone sermon to his congregation. However, the power of his sermon is rather diminished by the sight of him using a ragged sleeve of a shirt instead of a handkerchief when mopping his brow and blowing his nose. The end result is a build-up of suppressed laughter among the congregation until they can contain themselves no longer and the church erupts in mirth. The fact that a Church Minister could be ridiculed in print, tells us much about the changing social climate in Scotland at this time.

' Below the title we are told that 'This popular song can always be had at the Poet's Box, 224 Overgate, Dundee'. A 'tawse' was a leather strap that was used to punish badly behaved children.
This light-hearted ballad is written from the perspective of a nostalgic adult, fondly remembering the times when his mother used to physically chastise him for his errant behaviour. When a person was raised in this manner, it was said that they were 'brought up by hand'. The character considers the various methods and instruments of punishment that his mother used on him, and concludes that the 'Auld Pair o' Tawse' was the reprimand that made him feel 'glad'.

16352,ballad,RB.m.143(046),"The text preceding the ballad begins: 'This very comical song was written and sung by J. Kearney, in the character of 'Owney,' at the Castle Tavern, Dublin'. It was to be sung to the air, 'The Rakes o' Mallow'. The first verse begins: 'All you that are here attend, I pray, / And you shall hear, without delay, / About a party great and gay, / The type of all decorum'. Published in June 1851, this sheet could be purchased from the Poet's Box at No 6 St Andrew's Lane, Glasgow.
This broadside includes a rather interesting and witty introduction written by the publisher, the Poet's Box, along with a novel advertisement publicising their work. This light-heartedness is very much in keeping with the playful mood of the song itself. 
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

It was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow. The woodcut illustration at the top is a detailed and revealing town scene which focuses on two women chatting in the foreground.
Woodcut illustrations were often included not only to enhance the perceived value of the sheet but also the text, especially for less literate readers. Here, this busy town scene relates to the conversation and its context in the lyrics. Ballads, by this time printed on broadsides, were still part of the oral tradition, with many of them still being read aloud and memorised. The repetitive aspects of these lyrics all aided this process.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day. Cheaply available, they were sold on the streets by pedlars and chapmen. Broadsides offer a valuable insight into many aspects of the society they were published in, and the National Library of Scotland holds over 250,000 of them.",Broadside ballad entitled 'Arrah cushla Biddy won?t you take me now?',1852-1859

Bringing together the individual cries of market traders selling their wares, this broadside ballad gives the reader - and listener - a vivid aural impression of what the streets of Edinburgh must have sounded like between 150-200 years ago. The list of country produce, fish and drinks that were available in the marketplace of 'Auld Reekie', also tells us much about the various foodstuffs that people could buy. Many interesting broadside ballads such as this are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

15849,ballad,L.C.1270(016),"This ballad begins: 'Attend, you gallant Britons bold, unto these lines I will unfold / The deeds of valiant heroes I am going to relate'. This sheet was printed by James Kay of Glasgow and carries a woodcut illustration of a stylised 'Napoleon' - a figure wearing a bi-corn hat, sitting on rearing horse.
James Kay worked in Glasgow as printer during the mid-1840s. Anglo-French relations during this period were remarkably strained. There had been a relatively successfully alliance between the governments during the 1830s. This was mainly to insure that both powers maintained a strong presence in the Iberian Peninsula.
France, her economy and her army, were however, recovering after their depression and had carried out a number of successful political coups during the early 1840s. Lord Palmerston had returned to office as British foreign secretary and was renowned for his suspicion of the French.

There is a woodcut illustration above the title, which depicts a black woman holding a basket in front of a landscape with palm trees. This sheet was published by James Li[n]dsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow.
James Lindsay is known to have operated a printing business in Glasgow between 1847 and 1909. He worked out of 9 King Street, however, from 1852 until 1859. This broadside has an advert for over 5000 sheets of broadside stock, and he was also a prolific chapbook producer. Lindsay is also known to have been a stationer and private commissions printer.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate.

15836,ballad,L.C.1270(003),"This broadside contains two separate ballads. The first ballad begins: 'Upon a fair morning for soft recreation, / I heard a fair lady was making her moan, / With sighing and sobbing and sad lamentation, / Saying, my blackbird most royal is flown.'
The opening verse of the second ballad reads: 'My name's Duncan Campbell, from the shire of Argyle, / I have travelled this country for many a long mile; / I have travelled through England, and Ireland, and a', / And the name I go by is bold Erin-go-bragh.' This sheet was published by James Kay of Glasgow, whose business was located at 179 Argyll Street in 1844.
Employing imagery from nature in a romantic manner, the narrator of the first ballad appears to tell the sad tale of a young lady's missing blackbird, and his epic search for the exiled bird in Spain and France. This lament is an allegorical ballad in support of the exiled Jacobites, however, since the blackbird is a symbol for Charles Edward Stuart (1720-88). The second ballad tells of a Campbell from Argyllshire who, during a visit to Edinburgh, ends up assaulting a policeman who tries to arrest him on suspicion of being Irish. Immigrants from Ireland were mostly Catholic and poor, and suffered years of discrimination from the Scottish Establishment, which was staunchly anti-Catholic.",Broadside ballads entitled 'The Blackbird' and 'My Name is Duncan Campbell',1840-1850
20865,ballad,L.C.Fol.178.A.2(078),"Verse 1 begins: 'I will tell you a trick, that was played the other night, / Tis concerning a Doctor that dwells in this town.' There are no publication details given, but this is one of two songs - printed by James Lindsay - on this sheet. 
It is not clear in this song whether the 'black cook' refers to the cook's skin colour or his professional grade. Chefs were awarded a black band to wear around the bottom of their hat if they attained excellence and this sort of staff accolade may have been sought after by the gentry. Black household staff, on the other hand, are a literary motif which were used to best effect during the nineteenth century, where they often held white households together.

It is to be sung to the air 'The Laird o' Cockpen'. A woodblock of the Royal Coat of Arms adorns the top of the sheet. The sheet was published by G. Caldwell, of Paisley.
This broadside would have been highly topical when it was published, probably around 1832 when the debate over Earl Grey's (1764-1845) Reform Bill was at its peak. The Reform Act was passed in 1832 and its aim was to make constituencies more representative. The author of this piece says he is a Reformer, but from the tone it is safe to assume that he does not think the Reform Bill goes far enough. To the ordinary person it would not have make a blind bit of difference as eligibility was property-based.

'The Birth of Young Ned' is a song ostensibly celebrating the birth of Queen Victoria's first son, the future King Edward VII (1841-1910). In the final three verses, however, the words become critical of the public cost of the new prince's upkeep. The song's concerns about the morality of tax-payers financing the prince's lifestyle were quite prophetic: denied any public role by his mother, the adult Prince Edward became notorious for an extravagant lifestyle of gambling, drinking, fine eating and womanising.

The publisher was the Poet's Box, (probably Glasgow) but the town of publication has been obscured. The broadside was published on Saturday, 27th July 1867, priced at one penny.
'Bingen on the Rhine' is narrated by a German soldier who has been mortally wounded on the battlefield at Algiers. Although the ballad is written almost entirely in standard English, the use of the word 'aye' for 'always' in the second line of the third verse suggests that the song probably originated in Scotland rather than England or Germany. Deathbed ballads, last words and elegies were all very popular among the broadside-buying public.

Robert Burns wrote this ballad in late August 1787, during a visit to the Birks of Aberfeldy, then known as the Den of Moness. Legend has it that Burns wrote the song after resting in a natural seat on the rock, just at the side of the Birks. This natural seat is well-known and a plaque now exists at the exact spot where Burns was inspired to write the ballad. The accompanying woodcut to this broadside ballad shows a pastoral scene of young women playing, and the song's verses celebrate the reborn joys of nature in Spring and female beauty.

A note below the title states that 'Copies of this extremely popular song can only be had in the Poet's Box', (probably Glasgow) and that the ballad should be sing to an original tune. The sheet was published on the Saturday morning of August 18th, 1868.
This ballad celebrates the joys of the skylark - a bird that has come to symbolise freedom, ardour, joy, youth and happiness. In addition to symbolising these concepts, the skylark is also a symbol of the praying Christ, as he rises into heaven after blessing his disciples. The religious language and imagery employed in this ballad suggests that, on this occasion, the skylark is being used for its religious associations. A note below the title advertises the many services that the Poet's Box can offer its customers, while a list at the bottom of the sheet catalogues other ballads that are available for purchase.

This song was to be sung to an 'Original' tune, and was priced at one penny. It was published on Saturday, 10th January 1863, by the Poet's Box, probably in Glasgow.
This song has its roots in the slave trade between Africa and North America. Some of the songs sung by the African-American slaves were recorded and standardised by white collectors in much the same way Scottish ballads had been collected. Ironically, within a few years these songs were being performed as 'negro spirituals' by white entertainers to white audiences worldwide. 'Billy Pattison' may be an adaptation of such a song. Although containing the call-and-response structure that characterised many 'spirituals', it is about the murder of a white man by an African-American, and contains anti-black sentiments.

This ballad is dedicated to the passing of the Great Reform Act of 1832. At the time this momentous act was passed, Earl Charles Grey (1764-1845) was the Prime Minister, and also leader of the Whig party. The Scotsman, Joseph Hume (1777-1855), was a Radical who, from 1830 onwards, was regarded as the leader of the movement for universal suffrage. Although the 1832 Reform Act extended the franchise to numerous middle-class men, many Radicals (Hume included) considered it to be a weak piece of legislation, since it did not grant the franchise to the working classes.

The ballad was to be sung 'To its own proper Tune'.
Most of this ballad is narrated by an old man warning a young man about the perils of marriage. The narrator's most urgent concern is the amount of hard-earned money wives and children demand. The last part of the ballad is, however, given over to 'The Maid's Reply', where a woman speaker mocks the original narrator for being a liar and 'void of sence', and claims that because he witholds money from his wife, she must 'gain her living at some Game'. The 'game' in question is left to the imagination.

The town of publication has been obscured, but was probably Glasgow.
Various words in 'Belle Brandon' betray the fact that it is a song of American origin. There are references to the 'prairie' and to the arbour, both words that are far less common in Britain than in the United States, and there is also a reference to the 'red man', or Native American. The existence of broadsides like this is an example of how popular culture slowly became more cosmopolitan and broader in its worldview, as improved travel and postal services opened other countries up to Britain.

This particular sheet was published by the Poet's Box of the Overgate, Dundee, and probably sold for one penny. The three ballads featured all deal with the subject of love. Although 'The Beggar Man' and 'The Bonnie Lassie's Plaidie' could easily have ended in tragedy, as many traditional ballads do, they both in fact end on a very happy note. Along with 'The Band o' Shearers', which is light-hearted in tone, this broadside would have offered people a pleasant alternative to the grim crime reports that were also in circulation at this time.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.

The four songs on this broadside were probably widely popular at the time of publication. 'Highland Mary', Robert Burns's tribute to his lover Mary Campbell who died aged only twenty-three, is still very well known today. Likewise 'Amang the Rigs o' Barley' is a Burns lyric that is still widely recited today, and was included in the cult British film 'The Wicker Man'. 'Dumbarton's Bonnie Dell' is not well known today but was apparently written in the nineteenth century by someone named Meineke and dedicated to a Mrs Robert A. Taylor. 'Ye banks and braes' is also a well-known Robert Burns composition.

This broadside was published by Matthew Leitch, who is possibly also its author. Leitch wrote much of his own material, as well as commissioning other 'poets'. His printing firm operated out of 130 Gallowgate between 1849 and May 1851. A very prolific printer, Leitch was known for using local subjects for inspiration.

The Battle of Trafalgar (1805) was famously won by the British fleet under the command of Admiral Horatio Nelson. Fought on the seas near Cape Trafalgar, off the coast of south-west Spain, the British successfully defeated the allied French and Spanish forces. The victory at Trafalgar, although marred by the death of Nelson from a gunshot wound, prevented Napoleon from invading Britain and ensured British naval supremacy throughout the nineteenth century.

Tenements were brokered as the solution to overcrowded housing in heavily industrialised areas such as Glasgow, during the early-nineteenth century. Tenements consisted of a square block of flats built facing the front street, but enclosing a shared green at the back. The communal staircase for each side of the building was often a source of tension, as its cleanliness was a source of pride for the the block but required co-operation to maintain. This tension is explored and revealed in detail in this text.

This song was to be sung to an 'Original' tune and could be bought for one penny. It was published by the Poet's Box in Glasgow, from a manuscript 'kindly handed to the Poet by Mr Thomas Gallacher'. The 'Poet', in this context, was the proprietor of the Poet's Box.
This bizarre comic ballad brings the contents of a kitchen to life and describes them engaging in a fierce battle. The song's ironic punchline is that the broom and the dishcloth, which began the fight, have to clean up the kitchen the following morning. This subject matter certainly does not follow any established ballad conventions, and it is likely the song was written to entertain children. Structurally it is simple, written in four-line verses mainly composed of two pairs of rhyming couplets.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911.

The ballad's first line runs: 'Sebastapol lay shrouded in thick November's gloom'. The sheet was printed almost three years after the battle, by the Poet's Box of Glasgow, and cost one penny.
The Crimean War (1853-6) was between Russia and an alliance of Great Britain, France, Sardinia, and the Ottoman (Turkish) Empire. The Battle of Inkermann, or Inkerman as it is sometimes spelt, was one of the decisive events in the war. The French and British defeated the Russians at Inkermann, near Sevastopol. Over 15,000 men lost their lives, 12,000 of them Russians. The much lampooned Scottish poet William McGonagall composed a piece of the same title.

A note above the ballad states that it should be sung to the air of 'Guy Fawkes'. In addition to mentioning the composer of this song, the introductory text also mentions that 'Copies can only be had in the Poet's Box, 6 St Andrew's Lane, Glasgow'.
Written in the style of a mock-epic, this light-hearted ballad tells the story of a 'battle' that took place in Balfron between Irish navvies and Highlanders on one side, and various Scottish regiments on the other side. These navvies were working on the Glasgow Water Works, which is a pipeline that carries water from Loch Katrine to Glasgow, via Balfron. It appears that the townspeople of Balfron were worried about being overrun by these navvies with their 'foreign' ways and 'alien' language - hence the telegraph to Stirling Castle. Although the troops in Stirling quickly responded to the telegraph and soon arrived in Balfron by train, happily, their services were not needed as the navvies had left the town.

The Battle of Alma, fought on the 20th September 1854, the first of the Crimean War, was an outstanding Franco-British victory. General St Arnaud for the French and Lord Raglan for the English defeated General Menchikov's Russian troops, who lost about 6,000 men that day. This victory created an opening which allowed the French and British forces to advance to Sebastopol and their next engagement.

As well as the ballad, the sheet also includes an introduction about how 'peelers' are taking food from people's larders and blaming it on cats. 'Peelers' are policemen, the name is derived from the name of their founder, Robert Peel. At the bottom of the sheet is a flamboyant and eloquent advertisement written by the 'poet', who is probably the Poet's Box manager, Matthew Leitch. Apparently 'no sooner is a new song issued, than his Royal Yankee Press is at once put into requisition to supply the lieges with copies'.

This broadside was published by Lowden McCartney at the Poet's Box, 180 Overgate, Dundee. The songs featured are fairly typical of the standard stock-in-trade offered by broadside producers at this time - most likely the nineteenth century. Whilst many of the ballads published were well-established favourites that have continued to stand the test of time, a large number were the highly formulaic popular songs of their day and, as such, were disposable but enjoyable entertainment. According to an entry in 'The Girl's Own Paper' in 1884, 'The Children's home' was written by F. E. Weatherly, and arranged as a vocal duet by Alfred J. Caldicott from the favourite song by F. H. Cowen.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.

Many broadside ballads were concerned with the social roles men and women were expected to play. In ballads dealing with courtship, women were usually cast as the guardians of moral propriety while men were shown as hopelessly in thrall to their impulses. Ballads dealing with husbands and wives sometimes portrayed marriage as a battleground or a contest of wits, but this example reaffirms patriarchal roles where the man is the breadwinner and the woman manages the household. It is likely that this ballad originated in the Victorian period (1837-1901) where songs and poems celebrating and reinforcing women's domestic responsibilities were common.

The 'Contract of Enster' is a comic rendering of a marriage contract into rhyming Scots couplets. (Enster is an old spelling for Anstruther in Fife).The cause given for the marriage between the 'Raggit Sutor Man' and the 'good Daughter of old Andrew Bizie' is that 'they have no will to work' and that if they marry, they will be entitled to an inheritance from old Andrew. The author sustains the 'marriage contract' illusion to the extent of including a list of 'witnesses' at the end of the poem.

This ballad gives a very real impression of the 'Conoughtman's' wanderings through Glasgow. The majority of readers were probably familiar with the city, and would have found it easy to imagine the man from the west of Ireland making his way from the Exchange to George Square and on to the Green and the mills of Bridgeton. His strange encounters with various unusual characters along the way give this account a rather dream-like quality.

This ballad was published by the Poet's Box, Dundee.
This is a version of a song that is still widely known today. The chorus is taken from the street cry of Dublin fishmongers from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The character of Molly Malone has now entered Dublin folklore, but it is not known whether she really existed and if she did, whether she was actually a fishmonger or rather, as some have speculated, a part-time prostitute. Although known worldwide, the song has become Dublin's anthem and is mentioned in James Joyce's novel of the city, 'Ulysses'.

This comic song features a very drunk narrator who has been locked out of his house and is trying to persuade his wife to let him back in. The way the song is laid out on the page, incoporating stage directions and spoken interludes, confirms that it was intended for public performance, probably in a music hall. Music halls originated in British taverns and inns in the early nineteenth century, when landlords hired acts to entertain their customers. Soon music halls were being custom-built, and the phenomenon reached its peak in the 1880s.

This ballad was published by the Poet's Box, which advertises 'NEW SONGS OUT EVERY WEEK'. The town of origin is not specified, but it was probably published in Dundee.
This ballad is a lively celebration of the marriage and wedding ceremony of a Lanarkshire couple. Ballads written for and about weddings, containing refences to drink and dancing as well as a few bawdy asides, were quite common. 'Cocky-Bendy's Wedding O' fits easily into this tradition. The final verse suggests that the song may have been written as a toast to and gift for a real couple: 'May health and happiness be his, / In true love and connubial bliss'.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets.

There were many, many song sheets produced and sold during their period of popularity. As a result competition for sales was fierce and so gimmicks, such as illustrations and claims of popularity were included to boost sales. This was taken further by the patterers or chapmen who were responsible for selling them on the streets. They often sang ballads and tunes to advertise themselves, touting with other market-sellers for trade.

The lyrics of this song are rather offensive to modern sensibilities. It endorses men forcing themselves on young girls, until they give in. The singer tells of how he persuaded the collier's daughter to lose her virginity to him. He says in the second verse, 'And ay the more that she refus'd / the more [kisses and caresses] I was applying'. In the last verse we learn that the lassie is also sleeping with her father's master, the Laird. This song reveals much about attitudes to women and class in the early eighteenth century.

At the very bottom of the sheet, a short note states that the broadside was printed by Mr William Adam in May 1719, while the accompanying letters 'Edr' suggest that it was probably published in Edinburgh.
This ballad appears to be an attack on the Covenant Movement and the Protestant Succession, written by someone with strong Catholic sympathies. The image of the black cloak that dominates the ballad most likely symbolises some ritual from a religious ceremony. There are also references to the ending of Common Prayers, which Charles I had introduced in 1637. In addition to the religious symbolism, the ballad also contains references to the symbols of monarchy, such as the mitre and the crown. The references in verse four to the plundering of churches, also supports the interpretation that the ballad is a protest against the dominance of Protestantism.

'Freens' means 'friends', 'stappit' is 'full', 'muzzle' means 'face' and 'choker block' means 'chock-a'block'.
This light-hearted ballad tells the story of a coal delivery man called Jock. In the opening verses we learn that Jock is a hard-working man who likes a dram. Indeed, the first verse informs us that Jock is so full of drink that his coal cart has left the road. After this amusing mishap, Jock muses about his friends and the state of his relationships with them. The last two verses focus on the minister's doomed attempts to make Jock mend his wicked ways, and Jock's defiant response to the man of the cloth's ministrations.

16464,ballad,RB.m.143(174),"Verse 1 begins: 'The Clerk of the Pipe is a man of some weight. / And nothing will serve him but serving the state'. This song is labelled up as new and should be sung to the tune 'Down Derry Down'. Two woodcuts have been included, one of two gents drinking in a cellar and the other of a man in eastern garb, smoking a pipe.
The name 'Clerk of the Pipe' refers to an auditor of the Exchequer. The name derives from an earlier age, when Exchequer records were kept in 'Pipe Rolls' or long, narrow pieces of rolled up skin. The Exchequer controlled the amount of money issued both to the monarch and to the parliament to implement their policies and reforms. This song is praying for a progressively thinking clerk so that reforms can be implemented without too much fuss.
This style of text, with its implicit political propaganda, would not only have made for compelling entertainment, but would also perhaps have stimulated political thought, reasoning and debate.","Broadside ballad entitled 'The Clerk of the Pipe, Or, The Leith Reform Garland'",1830-1840

This light-hearted ballad muses on the advantages and disadvantages of married life and life as a bachelor. To support his argument that married life is best, the writer compiles a list of the simple pleasures that domesticity has to offer. Revealingly, however, these pleasures result directly from the hard work of his 'clean and tidy' wife. Indeed, this strong emphasis on a 'clean and tidy' wife providing a warm fire at the hearth recurs throughout the poem, illustrating the patriarchal nature of Scottish society at this time.

Beneath the title the text reads: 'Composed (as is supposed) by King JAMES the fifth'.
The immense popularity of 'Christ's Kirk on the Green' in Scotland led to many reprints being made over several centuries. The National Library of Scotland holds several broadside versions of the ballad in its collection, all subtly different in some details of wording or spelling. These differences reflect the tendency of ballad publishers to update spellings or styles to the standards of their era. One reason for the poem's popularity may have been the belief that it was written by King James V, but many modern scholars tend to doubt this attribution, believing the poem to have been written slightly earlier, possibly by James I, who lived from 1394-1437.

Many reprints were made of this poem, and all those held by the National Library of Scotland show subtle differences in wording and spelling, reflecting the 'corrections' that were made by publishers according to the standards af their day.
'Christs Kirk on the Green' became one of the most influential poems ever produced in Scotland, but was itself based on a Scots poem from c. 1430-1450, the anonymous 'Peblis [Peebles] to the Play'. The author of 'Christs Kirk', who may have been James I or James V, pays tribute to the earlier poem in his opening verse. Both poems describe a community event that degenerates into a bawdy brawl, and this theme would go on to inspire later famous poems such as 'Leith Races' by Robert Fergusson (1750-1774) and 'Holy Fair' by Robert Burns (1759-1796).

This broadside was published by J. Scott of Pittenweem in Fife, and sold by J. Wood of Edinburgh.
'The Child's Dream' is a dialogue between two children, in which they discuss how much better it would be to be in heaven than on earth. At the end of the poem it is revealed that the next winter, the two children and their mother were taken to be with their father in heaven. To most modern sensibilities this ballad would probably seem in quite bad taste, but in the late nineteenth century similar sentiments were commonly found in popular culture, especially among those writing 'Kailyard' literature, such as Ian Maclaren and J.M.

'Child with Three Fathers' is a humorous tale with moral overtones. A woman falls pregnant by a 'sporting young blade', who denies the baby is his and bribes two other young men to testify that it could just as much be theirs, too. Rather than deciding to drop the case, the 'bailie' orders all three contribute to the child's upkeep, leaving the young men aghast!

This light-hearted broadside contains a running dialogue between a farmer and the young man who wishes to marry his daughter. Although this country song is a humorous ballad, it is interesting to note that there are also two spoken parts included in the lyrics. Many cheery, rural broadside ballads such as this one are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

James Lindsay was a prolific broadside producer and distributor, and there are many examples of his work contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection. Farewells or reminiscences for sailors was also a popular broadside topic on Scottish sheets, especially given the country's proliferation of harbours and ports. This sheet, however, is more unusual, as the content is specifically aimed at Englishmen and the sailors' destination or purpose is not revealed.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.","Broadside ballad entitled 'Cheer, Boys, Cheer!'",1852-1859

This is one of many songs that have been written in praise of Scotland's landscape. The recurring phrase 'Thy enchantments will restore me' suggests that it is narrated from the point of view of someone who has just returned to the country from abroad. Laments and sentimental songs written by exiled or returning natives about Scotland and Ireland are common around the world, as both these countries experienced high levels of emigration in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

As a result, these sheets filled a much-needed gap in cheap and ephemeral entertainment. The subject matter, however, still had to be compelling and recognisable.

This was a popular ballad, first published as a broadside but later collected in 'Herd's Ancient and Modern Songs' in 1776.
'Bonnie Lizie Balie' is about a girl who falls in love with a Highlander against the wishes of her Lowland family, and despite having suitors in the Lowlands. Tension and distrust between Highlands and Lowlands existed for much of Scotland's history and are reflected in the country's art and literature. The Highlands was often perceived to be wild, foreign-tongued, violent and uncivilised. This perception began to take on a more romantic appeal in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, due to the popularity of James MacPherson's 'Ossian' poems and Sir Walter Scott's 'Waverley' novels.

This ballad is narrated by a young man who is about to go off to become a soldier. The 'bonnie lassie's answer' referred to in the title is his sweetheart's response of 'no, no' every time the narrator tells her he must leave. The theme of young men leaving their loved ones to join the army was quite a common one in ballads and popular songs. Sometimes the prospect of military service is portrayed as a heroic adventure, sometimes, as in this case, it is portrayed as financial necessity.

This sheet was published by James Lindsay of 11 King Street, Glasgow. The woodcut at the top of the sheet depicts a small town with three women standing talking together in the street.
This song deals with the common broadside theme of young lovers and their trials and tribulations. Here, the man feels that because he is poor he must leave his love. The only job which he can find is to leave Scotland as a soldier for the government. The girl is greatly vexed by the entire situation but, seeing that her lover will not be moved, offers to cross-dress and follow him into the army. The theme of disguised women entering men's professions, a well-attested reality in many cases, was also very popular on broadsides. It appears that this sort of adventure was appealing to the popular imagination.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

Scots soldiers enjoyed, and indeed in many ways still do enjoy, a formidable military reputation. This idea is supported and furthered by the hyperbole and romanticism of this text. There were many narratives, and even more ballads, which warned against the perilous and insecure life of soldiers' wives, whilst at the same time glamorising the lifestyle and position. This is a problem which is still a large feature in today's debates about the responsibility of media portrayals in social problems.

The broadside was published by the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee, and at the foot of the page, we learn that the publisher also runs a postal service for songs.
This ballad is a fairly conventional love song, narrated by a man who vows to wed the girl of his dreams despite the scorn of his parents. It is written in a variety of Scots that is marked as an north-east dialect by the presence of 'Fat' meaning 'what', and 'fu' meaning 'how'. These pronounciations are not common to west coast varieties of Scots.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

This song was to be sung to a tune named 'The Scarlet Flower'. The name and location of the published have been obscured on the broadside.
'Ellerslie' is an old spelling of the Scots village of Elderslie, Renfrewshire, which is best known as the birthplace of William Wallace. William Wordsworth referred to Wallace leaving his surname as his legacy, to be found all over Scotland like a 'wild flower'. Wallace has also been called 'Flower of Scotland' in the more modern song of that name by the Corries. Thus, although it might seem unusual, the poet here appears to be comparing his love's beauty not only literally to the beauty of a flower, but also in some way, to Scotland's warrior hero.

There are other ballads which mention Airlie. For instance, 'The Bonnie Braes o' Airlie' celebrates the area's beauty. Then there is another, more famous, song about the burning of Airlie Castle, the seat of the Ogilvies, by the Earl of Argyle's covenanting forces in 1640. This is called 'The Bonnie Hoose o? Airlie'. The Den of Airlie was made a national nature reserve in March 2001. It is located in Angus, between Ruthven and Kirkton of Airlie.

This simple love ballad gave its name to a famous collection of stories, 'Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush', written by 'Ian MacLaren' (Rev. John Watson) and published in 1894. This book in turn became synonymous with a certain period of popular Scottish fiction, the 'Kailyard' era, around the turn of the twentieth century, when Christian parables in Scottish rural settings gained huge popularity both here and in America. Very little of this fiction is widely available today, although one of the 'Kailyard' authors, J.M. Barrie, remains internationally famous for his later work 'Peter Pan'.

The song carries a dedication to the Countess of Airlie, of Airlie Castle. Near Alyth. Airlie Den, which is probably where this song refers to, is in Angus between Ruthven and Kirkton of Airlie. Underneath the piece it is interesting to note the list of popular songs also published by the Poet's Box.

The one included above the title depicts a young man and woman in a field with sickles. The other, at the end of the text, is of a fine lady wearing a grim facial expression.
This broadside addresses a common lyrical theme that of the differences between a blithe young girl and her older and wiser self. Bonnie Bessie is described as a slyph-like character radiating smiles and happiness wherever she is. Later, however, when the narrator returns from his travels he finds a more sober and domesticated Bessie, which does not please him. As a result he chooses to remember the younger Bessie.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day.

This most famous of Scottish folk songs is rumoured to have been written by a Jacobite prisoner, who was about to be executed for his part in the failed 1745-46 uprising. The dominant theme of the song is the ancient Celtic belief that if you die away from your home country, then your spirit returns home by an underground route called 'The Low Road'.

There are several theories concerning the ballad?s origins. One version is that the condemned prisoner wrote the song specially for his sweetheart. Another interpretation is that there were two Jacobite prisoners, with one of them being set free while the other was executed. This second version claims that the ballad was written by the prisoner who was sentenced to death, for the benefit of the pardoned Jacobite.

'Bonnets-o' Blue' could refer to two groups in Scottish Highland history. The Jacobite followers of Bonnie Prince Charlie, who fought government forces in 1715 and 1745, wore blue bonnets with white cockades. However, the government's Royal Highland Regiment, or Black Watch, which was formed from six independent companies in 1739, also wore blue bonnets with a 'Red Hackle' badge. The reference to 'Donald the chief o' the clan' does not clarify which group the song refers to, as Highland clansmen fought with both parties.

The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?!

Likewise, the writer also celebrates the beauty of the landscape, the wildlife and even the stormy weather! As highlighted by the recurring line of 'Auld Farran, &c' (a phrase that means 'old-fashioned', 'sagacious' and well-behaved'), the ballad is very much a tribute to the old traditions of rural life.

This ballad sings the praises of the Royal Highland Regiment, better known as the Black Watch, who wore small round blue bonnets. It concerns an incident during the Crimean War, 1854-6, when Queen Victoria sent her 'lads wi' the Bonnets o' Blue' 'up the Alma's grim heights for tae conquror or die'.

This short and catchy song is a bit of a double joke. The impressive opening lines, when performed by a street entertainer, must have caught the audience's attention. The song, however, is about a famed and loved entertainer, who always engages the audience's attention, called Blythe Johnny Drummond. The scenes described in the song, are about performing a broadside song for an audience and so it is an interesting picture for the modern reader. Johnny Drummond himself, unfortunately, is now largely untraceable.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate.

'Blue Bonnets Over the Border' is a famous Scottish ballad which refers to Bonnie Prince Charlie's march into England in 1745. A blue bonnet or beret was a traditional piece of highland dress and due to the large highland composition of the Jacobite Army became associated with their faction. This was taken one stage further by affixing a white cockade to it, which was an official emblem of Jacobite affiliation. Today the march is still a popular military anthem, although it is especially favoured in Canada.

The events referred to in this ballad took place during the Jacobite uprising of 1745. The Jacobite soldiers of Charles Edward Stewart, having taken control of most of Edinburgh, blockaded Edinburgh Castle, which was still occupied by a government garrison. After six days of siege, the garrison commander General Guest ordered a cannonade to be opened against the Jacobite soldiers, killing Jacobitres and citizens alike, but ultimately ending the blockade. Much of this ballad is narrated by Captain Taylor, a terrified Jacobite officer trapped in nearby Livingston's Yards, who laments taking part in the blockade.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

The broadside was published by the Poet's Box in Dundee. It does not carry a date of publication.
'The Drunkard's Raggit Wean' paints a pitiful picture of a child left hungry, cold and miserable through neglect by his drunken parents. This was clearly intended to provide moral instruction against the dangers of drinking alcohol to excess, and may have been linked to the Temperance Movement. The first Temperance Societies opened in Scotland in the late 1820s, and the movement gathered momentum throughout the nineteenth century. The Temperance (Scotland) Act in 1913, gave Scottish districts the opportunity to vote themselves 'dry'. Several did, but the Temperance Movement lost popularity as the century progressed.

There appear to be a number of different versions of this song. The one that was featured in Volume 6 of the 'Scots Musical Museum' (1803) begins: ' 'O where and O where does your highland laddie dwell; / He dwells in merry Scotland where the blue bells sweetly smell, / and all in my heart I love my laddie well'. In another version, meanwhile, the second line of the song reads, 'He's gone with streaming banners where noble deeds are done'. The words featured on this broadside refer to a young Scotsman going off to fight for king and country during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815). It is possible that variations occurred as different generations of listeners adapted this common theme.

James Lindsay operated his printing business between 1847 and 1907. Many of his premises were in the Saltmarket area of Glasgow, which was renowned for as an higher prolific with printing shops. As a result competition, although fond and familiar, was fierce, especially over quantities of sheets sold. Lindsay specialised in entertaining, rather than news, broadsides and was as equally involved in chapbook production.

Dundee is renowned for its numerous pubs, with roughly one pub to every 7 heads of household in Dundee, not all that long ago. This plaintive little piece, however, is an interesting social comment and shows that society was aware of the 'urchins' wandering the streets. Drinking and its results are not only highlighted here but this is also an interesting description of working class life and family expectations.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

Written from the wise perspective of a man who likes his drink but is no alcoholic, this thoughtful and light-hearted ballad rails against the hypocrisy of those people who criticise his drinking, but ignore their own drinking habits. In particular, the ballad targets kirk elders for their Janus-faced attitude towards drink. Resolving each verse with the philosophical and liberal refrain that folk are not so very different in their basic needs, this ballad is very much in the tradition of Burns' poems such as 'Address To The Unco Guid, Or The Rigidly Righteous'.

The broadside was published by the Poet's Box. 224 Overgate, Dundee.
The earliest printed ballads were versions of songs or poems from an oral tradition stretching back many years before printing was invented. Even as late as the nineteenth century ballads were written to be performed, and this example was clearly intended for performance by a man and a woman. The verses are narrated by the cart driver, the choruses by the woman he has given a lift to, and before each chorus there is a spoken aside by the woman, confiding her feelings for the cart driver. It is a theatrical structure.

This ballad is not dated, but judging from its story - of a child left homeless and hungry by a mother's death and father's alcoholism - it is most likely to be from the mid-nineteenth century. In this period crusading movements against alcohol and private philanthropy towards children's charities increased dramatically. The huge success of Dickens novels like 'Oliver Twist' suggests the appetite the middle and upper classes had for tales of poverty and hardship, and the era spawned many lesser imitators and writers with similar concerns.

The broadside was published by The Poet's Box, 224 Overgate, Dundee, which advertises at the top of the sheet, 'NEW SONGS OUT EVERY WEEK', and at the bottom, 'Songs sent to any part of the country on receipt of postage stamps'.
This ballad concerns a man who has enlisted to be a soldier in the 42nd regiment or 'Black Watch', leaving his sweetheart at home. The voice narrating the ballad seems to change throughout. The first two lines are sung by someone standing apart and describing the 'puir lassie's situation, but the next two seem to be sung by the 'puir lassie' herself. The chorus is then sung, appropriately, as a group: 'Let us drink and be merry'. Such changes in narrative were quite common in ballads, perhaps reflecting the fact that they would be performed by someone who would assume the different character roles during the unfolding of the ballad.

'
In its attack on Brigham Young (1801-77), the founder of the Mormon Church, this ballad is not perhaps the best example of religious tolerance. The ballad's reference to a possible jail sentence for Young, suggests that it was written some time in 1871, for it was in this year that Young faced polygamy charges in a federal court. The fact that such an unusual ballad could be sold in Scotland, shows that people took a keen interest in the world around them - although, admittedly, much of the ballad does take a rather prurient interest in Brigham Young's complicated matrimonial affairs.

The first reference in this text is to the Darien Scheme established roughly between 1695 and 1700. This was to be Scotland's first colonial exercise, (to the isthmus of Panama) earlier attempts having been blocked by English traders. Scotland was inspired by the thought of increased trade and opportunities and it is thought that over half the Lowland population invested some money in it. However, the scheme proved to be a disastrous washout, with many Scots dying on foreign shores. Most of the rest of this text is a warning against the evils of money, profit and foreign travel.

This light-hearted ballad details a dispute that raged on regarding a dyke that was built along the edge of the Clyde. It appears that the wall blocked a pathway favoured by a large number of people in the Glasgow area and, as such, its construction was vehemently protested. The dyke being referred to is almost certainly 'Harvie's Dyke', the protests against which led to a court case and a final decision in favour of the protestors being passed in the House of Lords. The National Library of Scotland's collection includes several broadsides regarding 'Harvie's Dyke'.

As with many early ballads, the origins of 'The Dowie Dens o' Yarrow' are shrouded in mystery. A popular and well-known song, there are still to this day a number of different versions in existence, including one which starts 'There lived a lady in the North'. As part of the oral tradition, it was common for ballads to undergo changes with each telling. The Yarrow Valley stretches down through the Scottish borders towards Selkirk. Although neither were responsible for this ancient ballad, the Scottish literary heavyweights, James Hogg (1770-1835) and Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), are both said to have drawn inspiration for their work from the beautiful Yarrow Valley.

As with many broadside lyrics this a humorous and gentle warning on the subject of love, which would probably have been instantly recognisable to most of the audience. Paddy had a few doubts about marriage despite his overwhelming love for Biddy. After a night of binge drinking with the boys, however, he collapsed and dreamt of Biddy. He thought he was cuddling into her but, upon awaking, realised he had really been rolled up next to the neighbour's ass. Horrified and mortified, he ran straight home to patient and understanding Biddy, and proposed marriage!

15850,ballad,L.C.1270(017),"The first ballad begins: 'Come all you true-born Irishmen wherever ye be, / I pray you give attention, and listen unto me'. This song is given the greatest space and boldest print on the sheet and so must have been given more precedence.
The second ballad, 'Silver Bells', was a Victorian music hall song by Harry Thomas Dale. Dale was born in Birmingham in 1844 and died in Ashington, Northumberland in 1914 aged 70.  He wrote over 300 songs for the music hall and performed regularly in Scotland at such venues as the Britannia Music Hall in Glasgow. Later in his career he became a Jester performing with John Henry Cooke's Royal Circus in Edinburgh. The third ballad begins: 'At dreary midnight's cheerless hour, / Deserted e'en by Cynthia's beam'. These two ballads have been given a smaller and divided space, perhaps denoting that they are of lesser importance or value. This sheet was published by James Kay of Glasgow.
Broadsides were sold to large numbers of people who then shared them with even larger audiences. They were a cheap and common form of social entertainment in age without television and radio. Buying a sheet with more than one song on it would have made hard-headed money sense but a sheet with three songs on is relatively unusual!","Broadside ballads entitled 'Donnelly and Cooper', 'Silver bells' and 'Larboard Watch'",1870-1900

Below the title we are told that, 'This popular song can always be had at the Poet's Box, 224 Overgate, Dundee'.
The essential message that the narrator of the ballad wishes to convey is that since life is short, we should try to be as friendly and helpful to one another as possible. The list of popular songs at the bottom of this sheet is very interesting, with 'The Iron Horse' ballad being an imaginative nickname for an early rail locomotive. As many ballads were written to commemorate special occasions, such lists often help historians to roughly identify the publication date of broadsides.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson. 
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

This sheet was published by James Lindsay of 11 King Street, Glasgow.
The second ballad begins: 'Gae bring my guid auld harp ance mair, / Gae bring it free and fast, / For I maun sing anither sang, / E'er a' my glee be past . . . '
This broadside contains two separate ballads, thus providing the buyer with two songs for the price of one. In 'Donald's Return To Glencoe', a young man meets a young woman at the banks of a fountain in Glencoe. Despite the ominous setting for their meeting, this ballad is in fact a love song - with the last verse suddenly revealing a happy and unexpected twist in the tale. The second ballad, 'Scotland Yet', is an epic-type eulogy to a Scotland of the glorious past, with references to William Wallace, the Ossian poems and 'freedom'.",Broadside ballads entitled 'Donald's Return To Glencoe' and 'Scotland Yet',1860-1890
16850,ballad,L.C.Fol.178.A.2(206),"This ballad begins: 'As I was walking one evening of late, / When Flora's gay mantle the fields decorate, / I carelessly wandered where I did not know, / On the banks of a fountain that lies in Glencoe.' Two woodcut illustrations decorate this sheet, one of a man and a woman in a rural setting and the other of a young woman on her own.
Donald's wanderings bring him into contact with a young woman named Flora. Upon talking to her, he realises that the young woman is awaiting the return of her sweetheart, also called Donald, from the wars in Europe. The ballad ends on a happy note, with her realisation that the stranger she is confiding in is none other than her beloved Donald. Another broadside in the National Library of Scotland's collection, entitled 'The Massacre of Glencoe', which features two characters of the same name, sadly does not have such a happy ending!

Many of Pitts's publications are on Scottish topics and have found their way into Scottish collections. There are many of them in National Library of Scotland's Collection. It would suggest that Pitts's system of distribution was excellent, if his sheets were travelling so far. It would also suggest that contrary to popular belief, items on a Scottish theme were popular with audiences of all nationalities. This song was written by the Orcadian David Vedder (1790-1854) and appeared frequently in chapbooks and - as here - on broadsides.

This was a popular song not only in Dundee, but also in Perthshire, Fife and Forfarshire. It was written by Orkneyman, David Vedder (1790-1854). Over the years, the Poet's Box were registered at several different premises in the Overgate, and were prolific publishers of ballads like this. A list of other songs available is included at the bottom of the sheet.

The content of this ballad, is an interesting twist on a common broadside theme. Many broadsides held in the National Library of Scotland's collection - both fact and fiction- deal with the personal and social consequences of drunken husbands. This sheet, however, carries stories of women, all wives, who have a debilitating drink habit. They are accused of neglecting their children's welfare and causing their husbands great distress, as well as letting themselves down badly.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

Chorus: 'Come awa' wi' me, lassie, / Come awa' wi' me lassie, / I'll row ye in my tartan plaid. / My lowland bride - my bonnie lassie.'
This ballad appears to be a grotesque parody of the type of romantic love songs that were commonly printed on broadsides. Various romantic conventions feature, including professions of undying love and imagery from nature. However, the twist in the tale is that the 'lowland lassie', who is the poem's romantic focus, is expected to share a bed with Donald and his mother. Donald resolves the situation by kicking his mother 'oot ower the bed' and almost killing her. It may be that the ballad was intended to be a satire on the 'romantic Highlander' that was a popular literary figure in the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Broadside ballads covered many subjects, from love to war, and often contained some deeper moral message. 'An Account of the Doctor and his Patients' is primarily a comic song. Its 'message', plainly printed at the end, is that despite advice and warnings about what is 'right', humans will continue to act on their impulses and appetites: 'The wife may preach, and Satyrists rail, / Custom and Nature will prevail.'

A note below the title states that ' Copies of this highly popular song can only be had in the Poet's Box', (probably Glasgow) and that the sheet cost one penny. A further note mentions that the ballad should be sung to an original tune.
Set in Glasgow, this romantic ballad is written from the viewpoint of a young man who was been thunderstruck by the grace and beauty of a young woman called Diana Kitty Annie Maria, whom he encountered while out walking. Madly in love with his sweetheart, the young suitor proceeds to describe the various places in Glasgow that he and his beloved have visited, plus the favourable reaction that Diana's beauty has aroused in Glasgow. The stricken suitor concludes his tale by telling his audience about his ambitious plans to marry Diana, and the number of children he hopes they will have together.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were.

The broadside was published in 1716 by John Reid of Pearson's Close in Edinburgh.
The biblical tale of Christ being tempted in the wilderness by Satan was probably the inspiration for this ballad. The ballad appears to be a very serious attempt to convey the correct way of living to its readership. Satan's recurring argument is that the Young Man has many years in which to live a sinful, reckless life and still repent; the Young Man's consistent response is that he must be constantly striving to lead a good life, and that earthly temptations lose their appeal when compared with Christian salvation. He warns, though, that not all men are as aware of this as he: 'Wisdom's but rare, those that be wise are few'.

It was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow (1852-59), and includes three woodcut illustrations along the top.
Most of Lindsay's broadsides, and he produced many, carry an illustration and, more unusually perhaps, they are often relevant to the text. Here two biblical scenes have been included, one of them set in a modern context. This helps enhance the moral reminder contained in the text. There are also two decorative motifs included. The cartouche on the right can be seen on other Lindsay sheets. It is relatively unusual to find a printer with such a large stock of expensive woodcuts of such varied themes.

Illustrated with woodcuts depicting martial scenes, this broadside refers to the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715. It was 'Bobbing' John Erskine, the Earl of Mar, who raised the standard for the House of Stewart, following his sacking by King George I. Leading the Protestant and Hanoverian forces against Mar's army, meanwhile, was the Duke of Argyll. The two armies engaged one another at Sheriffmuir, just outside Stirling. However, just when victory was in his grasp, Mar lost his nerve, and  inexplicably withdrew his army from the battlefield. Many historians argue that if Mar had held his nerve, then the Stewarts might well have been returned to the throne.

This Scots ballad is structured as a dialogue between an old man and his daughter's prospective husband. The discussion is over the extent of tocher the young man can expect to gain from the marriage. 'Tocher' is a Scots term for a bride's family's contribution to a marriage arrangement, and is derived from the Gaelic 'tochradh'. A tocher might typically consist of linen, crockery or silverware, but in this ballad the father appears to be able to offer only some flea-ridden bedclothes, some plough stilts, a wooden chest and some meal sacks.

This light-hearted ballad is narrated by a lovesick young schoolboy, who tries unsuccessfully to woo a number of schoolgirls from different countries, who all - rather strangely - study at a local girls? school. Despite his best attempts at sweet talk, the Scottish, French, German and Greek girls all reject his romantic overtures. Although the audience should not really be taking any pleasure in the poor boy's misfortunes, each one of these ill-starred romantic dialogues is very amusing - particularly the rejection by the Scots lass, which is written in broad Dundonian.

The broadside does not carry the name of its publisher, nor the place or date of publication. It is decorated with a woodcut of a thistle.
'Charlie Grey' is a reference to Earl Charles Grey (1764-1845), who became Whig Prime Minister in November 1830, and whose government was responsible for passing the Parliamentary Reform Bill of 1832. The song was clearly written by a Scottish supporter of Grey, and sings the praises of leading Scottish Whigs and Radicals of the period. Its references to bagpipes and  glens indicate that it was inspired, ironically, by ballads written about the possible return of Bonnie Prince Charlie, the most famous of which was 'Will Ye No' Come Back Again?' The irony is that the Whigs were the traditional opponents of the Jacobites.

This amusing ballad tells the picaresque tale of a woman who loses her sight and, thanks to the intervention of a quack doctor caled Dr Snigum, ends up acquiring the eyesight of a cat. Verging on the supernatural at times, this surreal ballad describes the humorous escapades that occur as a result of her viewing life with a cat's eyesight. In short, this ballad is the perfect illustration of the proverbial ""shaggy dog's tale"" - or rather a ""shaggy cat's tale"".

This broadside was published by J. Scott of Pittenweem in Fife, and sold by J. Wood of 49 North Richmond Street in Edinburgh.
This song is better known as 'Highland Mary', and was written by Robert Burns. The absence of a properly standardised or enforced copyright law until 1912 made it easy for broadside publishers to reproduce songs without acknowledging the author, and could change wording or titles at will. 'Highland Mary' was about Mary Campbell (1763-86), a woman of Highland descent whom Burns met when she was employed as a dairymaid at Coilsfield, seat of the Montgomerys in Ayrshire. The two became lovers before Mary's tragically early death.

Carters had a reputation for being both poor and drunk. As a result, many members of society endured their existence out of necessity. This poem takes an enlightened stance on the treatment and care of work animals. Its rather critical stance perhaps suggests that the 'by a Carter' comment is a literary device to drive the message home.

The narrative is comic and unusual - the Duke of Argyle takes the Lass o' Ballochmyle (named, presumably, after the Burns poem of the same name) to the Carse o' Gowrie Dairy.

Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

14475,ballad,Ry.III.a.10(022),"Verse 1: 'Now Brave Captain Gordon's come, / And brought more Prizes with him home / Let's Drink a Cup full to the brim, / In Health to Captain Gordon, / Because where ever he appears, / He clears Our Coasts of Privateers, / Makes Merchant Ships Trade without fears / Through out the Northern Ocean.' The ballad was to be sung 'To an Excellent New Tune, Hark I hear the Cannons Roar'.
The 'Captain Gordon' toasted here may be the same man featured in Robert Burns' verse epistle 'To Captain Gordon'. This cannot be verified, because the broadside is not dated, and Burns' poem makes no reference to his addressee defeating privateers. Privateers were pirates, and British waters continued to be troubled by piracy throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as they had been for centuries beforehand. The event that gave rise to this ballad in praise of Admiral Thomas Gordon (1658?-1741) occurred in 1704 when Gordon who was captain of the 'Royal Mary' a vessel of the Scottish navy, captured a French privateer and brought her in to Leith. Gordon was very much a Scottish hero and even more so when he helped a French spy to land at Slains Castle to visit Jacobite supporters. These events took places against the backdrop of the debate over the Union with England and this is clearly referred to in the ballad with mentions of 'tyrannie' and 'slaverie'. The 'Annandale' mentioned halfway through the ballad was a Scottish ship seized by the (English) East India Company in 1704.

16708,ballad,APS.3.96.25,"The first verse reads: 'Come all young men and maidens atend unto my ryme, / Tis of a lovely female was scarcely in her prime, / Her cheeks they were like a rose admired all around, / She was call'd young Carroline of Edinborough Town'. It was advertised as 'A much admired song' and includes a woodcut illustration of a haughty young woman being pursued by a man pulling a cart. The broadside was published by P. Brereton [?] of Dublin, and probably sold for one penny.
In typical ballad style, there is a tragic end and, most importantly, a moral to the tale of 'Carroline of Edinburgh Town'. After finding what she believes to be true love with 'Young Henery', and subsequently meeting the disapproval of her parents, Caroline is persuaded to run off with her sweetheart. Once she is far from home, she soon discovers his true nature and, in her misery, resorts to suicide. This tragic, but highly formulaic, tale not only carries a warning for young women to be wary when they fall in love, but also for parents to be more tolerant and understanding.

The song was published at 190 and 192 Overgate, Dundee, probably by the Poet's Box, and priced one penny.
This ballad is narrated by an old Highland soldier, and appears to be set in the aftermath of one of the Jacobite uprisings of the eighteenth century. The narrator refers to his sons having been killed and the homes of his kinsmen having been burnt. This suggests that the ballad is referring to the 1745-6 uprising, which provoked harsh reprisals against Highland Jacobites by the Duke of Cumberland's men after the decisive battle at Culloden. The cruelty is recalled in the poignant image, 'For the dew it lies red on the vales of Lochaber'.

'Sich a Getting Up Stairs' begins: 'At Kentuck last night a party met, / Dey say dem going to hab a treat'. The sheet was published by J. Harkness of Church Street, Preston, and is illustrated with two woodcuts.
The two ballads on this sheet are very different in tone. 'The Caledonian Laddie' is about a young Scotsman marrying his sweetheart. 'Sich a Getting Up Stairs' is about a party held by African Americans in Kentucky. The song is supposed to be written in an African American English dialect, and its language and sentiments are very hostile towards black Americans. Its publication in Britain (probably in the late nineteenth century), on a broadside intended for public entertainment, portray the prevailing social attitudes of the time.

Many of these broadside songs are firmly based in the oral tradition and as such contained easy to remember repetitive elements like the chorus and request to 'bundle up'. This song is a strange mixture of practical and romantic love which must in some capacity reflect the society which it was written in. It is also reveals the extent of parental guidance in match-making, and the prevalence of and opportunity for more casual love affairs.

This broadside ballad is a eulogy - or threnody - to Scotland's national bard, Robert Burns. In short, it is a literary form of the 'immortal memory', as proclaimed on the 25th of January by Burns' societies the world over. A festival in the poet's honour was held at Alloway in 1844, and the ballad might well have been written specially to celebrate this event. Likewise, the centenary of Burns' birth in 1859 also witnessed nationwide celebrations of his work. The accompanying woodcut shows two ancient lyres entwined by a crown of laurel, this being the classical symbol for a poet who wrote verses of great lyrical beauty.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century.

Included at the top of the sheet is a small illustration of a lyre surrounded by foliage and musical notation.
This ballad celebrates the very real and deep love that existed between Robert Burns (1759-96) and Mary Campbell (1763-86), also known as Highland Mary. At least two of Burns's compositions are said to have been inspired by her, 'Highland Mary' and 'The Highland Lassie, O'. Tragically, Mary's life was cut short in 1786 when she died of a fever, which some sources suggest was the result of a problematic pregnancy. Burns appears to have been deeply affected by her death, and for years after made frequent references to her in his correspondence - even after his marriage to Jean Armour.

A catechism is a collection of questions and answers pertaining to the Bible. It was intended to ensure that churchgoers were versed in the moral teachings of the Bible even if they had difficulty remembering long passages of scripture. The Shorter Catechism, created in 1648, is still used today in the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland. In this poem, the question and answer structure of the Catechism is adopted to satirise civic corruption in the royal burgh of Burntisland, Fife. Among various charges, councillors are accused of accepting bribes, and the priest of being a puppet of the local landowner.

This ballad laments the sad fact that the Scottish poets and songwriters living in the unspecified period in which the broadside was published, are not nearly as good as Robert Burns (1759-96) and Robert Tannahill (1774-1810). Clearly, the author regards the dying embers of the Scottish Enlightenment as a golden age for writing in Scotland. Accompanied by five woodcuts, the four verses and the chorus all contain a closing refrain that toasts the immortal memory of Burns and Tannahill. The ballad also celebrates the lowly social status of the two poets, hinting at the fact that a poetic fortune is a different type of currency entirely.

The second ballad begins: 'Gae bring tae me a pint o' wine, / And fill it in a silver tassie, / That I may drink, before I go, / A service to my bonnie lassie.'
The National Library of Scotland has several broadsides in its collection on the subject of Robert Burns (1759-96) and Highland Mary's pastoral romance. Indeed, Burns wrote several poems about her himself: 'Gae Bring tae me . . .' often called 'The Silver Tassie', is one such piece. In it, Burns bemoans that he must leave his 'bonnie Mary' and commentators have judged it safe to assume that this refers to Mary Campbell, or Highland Mary.",Broadside ballads entitled 'Burns and his Highland Mary' and 'Gae Bring tae me a Pint o' Wine',1880-1900
14987,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(58a),"Verse 1: 'In Glasgow's famous streets, / Some little boys began, / To amouse themselves, as all kids would, / With the butcher's greasy van. / ""It shall not be,"" the butcher cries; / I'll chap each little rascal's head,"" / He cried with indignation; / The butcher he ran down the street, / The bobby there he chanced to meet, / And he charged him to the station.' The ballad was to be sung to the air 'The Battle of Stirling Bridge'. It was published by the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee, priced one penny.
This comic ballad appears to be a satire on heavy-handed policing. A group of boys are chased by a butcher after making fun of his greasy van. The butcher runs into a policeman and makes a complaint, and a dozen armed police raid the boys' homes by night and imprison them. In court, each boy is 'sentenced' to 'Go home and get your porridge'. The term 'bobbies' is derived from the name of the then Home Secretary, Robert Peel, who founded the Metropolitan Police in 1829.

A note at the foot of this sheet states it was published by 'Moore, Printer, Cheapside, Belfast'.
This ballad celebrates the beauty of Mary Campbell (1763-1786), who was the inspirational Muse behind the songs by Robert Burns, 'Highland Mary' and 'The Highland Lassie, O'. Legend has it that Burns asked Mary to go to Jamaica with him, which she consented to, but that she died in Greenock from a fever - possibly during a premature childbirth - before they could leave. Although Burns's friends tried to dissuade him from continuing his relationship with Mary by highlighting her reputed looseness, Burns ignored their advice. This ballad tells the sad story of the love affair between Burns and Mary Campbell, with the final setting of the ballad being a graveyard in Greenock. The printer, Moore, may have been James Moore who had a Poet's Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856. It is not known if there was any connection between Moore and the Poet's Boxes in Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow.

A large number of broadsides assumed a certain degree of knowledge amongst their readership and, as a result, gave little or no contextual information. Although this often makes it difficult for a modern-day audience to identify the characters and incidents described, they were usually familiar to the readers of the day.

This sheet was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow. The illustration over the title is a woodcut of a little boy cuddling a goat, in what appears to be a yard.
James Lindsay, printer, stationer and supplier, is known to have worked from 9 King Street between 1852 and 1859. The National Library of Scotland's collection contains a good number of sheets from Lindsay's press and he appears to have been a prolific broadside producer. Many of his sheets include woodcuts which would have added to the perceived value of the sheet greatly - a good marketing ploy.

This broadside was priced at one penny and published on Saturday, 6th September 1856, by the Poet's Box. The town of publication has been obscured, but it was probably Glasgow.
This is a ballad praising the British armed forces. 'Britannia' here is used as a poetic name for Great Britain rather than as a specific reference to any of the naval vessels that have been named 'Britannia'. The third verse pays tribute to someone called Napier. This could be either Naval Commander Charles Napier (1786-1860) or more likely, as the tribute appears to be posthumous, General sir Charles Napier (1782-1853), who achieved significant military victories in the Indian sub-continent.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were.

Although no date has been included on this broadside, it is known that James Lindsay had premises at 11 King Street between 1860 and 1894. It is, therefore, safe to assume that this sheet was printed during these years. Although published in Glasgow, this broadside clearly has an Irish theme. During the years of industrialisation, the Irish population in Scotland reached record levels as countless thousands travelled in search of work. Broadside producers took advantage of this by publishing traditional Irish ballads and news from 'home', hoping to appeal to the large Irish population. Sadly, it also led to broadsides that fuelled resentments towards the Irish by reducing them to hateful stereotypes.

This sheet was published by the Poet's Box of Dundee and would have cost a penny to buy.
Father O'Flynn's name has a definite Irish origin and the lyrics of the song refer to areas in and the ideals of Ireland. Certainly there was a growing community of Irish immigrants living in the area of Lochee, Dundee, as the Jute mills continued to expand providing a source of employment. It is not clear from this sheet though whether the lyrics were written in Dundee or if they were copied directly from an existing Irish tune.

The ballad is about the Salvation Army, and the fact that, in England, Salvationists were generally perceived as a 'queer lot of beings'. It must have been published after 1878, when The Christian Mission adopted its new name.
An interesting woodcut depicting a man wearing a large hat with a white bow around his neck decorates the top of the sheet. He looks uncomfortable, standing praying with his toes turned inward. Two women in large bonnets, also praying, are in the background in front of a church, just visible in the distance.

The sheet was published by William Markham Brown of 3 Davidson Street, Airdrie.
This well-written, charming piece tells the story of 13-year-old Johnny Johnson, who was murdered in Airdrie, for the 'paltry sum of ninepence'. It appears that his body was burned by the culprit, a woman, and she tried to smuggle it in a bundle to Glasgow for disposal. Luckily, a woman saw a boot protruding from the bundle and alerted the authorities. The murderess was caught and Johnny was given a proper burial.

Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

This ballad is a pessimistic account of the determination of Napoleon Bonaparte to conquer Scotland and the lack of action of Scots people to obstruct him. In fact, contemporary Scots fair badly in comparison with William Wallace and Robert Bruce. This allusion to Scottish freedom fighters would suggest that the author may be Scottish. There are other broadsides held in the National Library of Scotland's collection which express concerns about a French invasion into Scotland. It would appear that this was an especially worrying time for Scottish society.

The curling pond, situated at the northern end of the mid-links, is just outside the town of Montrose. Curling was a hugely popular winter sport in Scotland, with many of her natural lochens being used to maximum effect. The lochen at Montrose is still in use, but just as a pond now. Altercations with the devil, formed a popular topic in the moral forums on broadsides and there are many examples held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative. Broadside authors tended to see themselves as moral guardians and teachers in society. As such, publishers often disseminated 'educational' texts outlining the social and personal consequences of undisciplined or immoral behaviour.","Broadside ballad entitled '""The Deil's Boolin' Match"" on Montrose Green'",1880-

This ballad is an elegy dedicated to the memory of General Charles Gordon (1833-85), who was killed by the Mahdi's troops during the siege at Khartoum, in the Sudan, Africa. The song of mourning repeatedly emphasises the sad fact that if only the relief force had arrived slightly sooner, then Gordon's life would have been saved. The author ends his elegy on a note of political intrigue, by mentioning that there are people who shamelessly abandoned Gordon in his hour of need.

It should be sung to its original tune. This sheet was published by the Poet's Box, Glasgow and would have sold for a penny a sheet.
Poet's Boxes are one of the more enigmatic broadside publishers and distributors. The sheets were produced cheaply and quickly by contracted printers and as a result very little information is recorded. It is known from other sheets, however, that poems could be commissioned and new sheets were regularly promoted. This sheet also advertises other printing services, such as calling cards and letterheads as well as offering a postal service for distribution.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box.

The second ballad begins: 'The cloth was laid in the Vorkhouse hall, / The great coats hung 'gainst the white washed wall'. The sheet was published by J. Sharp of 30 Kent Street, Borough, London. A decorative woodcut had been included down the left side of the sheet.
The first ballad is a memorial to the Right Honourable James Abercrombie, Lord Dunfermline and Speaker of the House of Commons 1835-9. The second details the lot of a young worker in the local work- or poor- house. The two seem unrelated topics, but Abercrombie was an acquaintance of Francis Hurst through their mutual friend the Duke of Devon. Hurst, the son of a draper, became the Chairman of the Board of Guardians for his local workhouse.",Broadside ballads entitled 'Death of Abercrombie' and 'Workhouse Boy',1844-1850

The poem is prefaced by stern quotes from the bible that include 'She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth' (Timothy, verse 6) and 'Tremble, ye women that are at ease' (Isaiah).
This ballad is structured as a dialogue between Death and a woman, and is clearly intended for moral instruction. The implication is that the woman has led an extravagant, sinful life, and death has caught her before she has had the chance to reflect and pursue a more Christian lifestyle. The fact that this heavy-handed lesson is aimed specifically at women illustrates the Calvinist, paternalistic, sometimes misogynistic moral codes that prevailed in Scottish society of the time.

There is a lot of extraneous text carried on this sheet, which is quite unusual for the Dundee Poet's Box. Most of this text is advertising, price details, vendor's address and other songs that are available. Unfortunately, the woodcut shadow does not belong to this sheet, but has been transferred from the sheet which was lying on top of it.

A chain-detail decorative border has been included on the sheet to increase its perceived value.
Broadsides were sold as the cheap and mass entertainment of their day. They were intended to be read out loud to groups of people in pubs, coffee houses and at home. As a result, the stories are often entertaining narratives, which cover topics which would have been instantly recognisable to many sections of the society they were published in. Hunting for birds and rabbits and the mention of crows and swans would probably have endeared this song to the audience quite quickly!

The author of 'Loch Katrine Water' is given as 'JOHN WILSON, Ballad-Singer', and the poem is dedicated to 'Her Majesty'. The sheet carries no date or publication details.
'Loch Katrine Water' is a poem inspired by Queen Victoria's opening of the Loch Katrine Water Supply Scheme in October 1859. The building of 26 miles of aqueduct and a storage reservoir at Mugdock allowed fresh water from Loch Katrine to be distributed to Glasgow, ending the city's reliance on old wells and reducing the danger from water-borne disease such as cholera. Loch Katrine is also famous as the inspiration for Sir Walter Scott's poem 'The Lady of the Lake'. 'Darlin' Old Stick' mentions 'Cow-bull', or Kabul, which is probably a reference to the British Army's Afghanistan Campaign, and thus dates this broadside to later than 1878, when the Afghanistan Campaign began.

Broadsides were generally sold for a penny a sheet. It was usual for just one ballad to appear on each sheet, so this example, which contains two songs and a woodcut illustration, would have represented good value. Broadsides were produced quickly and were not edited as thoroughly as modern newspapers and books, so misprints and spelling errors were common, as is evidenced by verse one of 'The Moon'.",Broadside ballads entitled 'The Dark-hair'd Girl' and 'The Moon',1850-1870

These three separately-titled ballads are collected on one broadside named 'Melodist'. The inclusion of more than one song or report on a broadside was not particularly uncommon, but the presence of a separate umbrella title for the broadside is more unusual, and suggests that this may have been one of a series of broadsides or songsheets entitled 'Melodist', that perhaps included two or three different songs every issue.

It seems the sheet was published in Edinburgh by someone called 'G.J.'.
Although this broadsheet states that Captain Thomas Green and two of his crew were executed for piracy and murder, these three seamen were in fact victims of judicial murder and mob rule. In a febrile atmosphere of anti-Englishness, officials from the Darien Company and an Edinburgh mob had seized the crewmen from their trading vessel, The Worcester, on a trumped-up act of piracy committed off the coast of Malabar. Executed at Leith among scenes of brutish jubilation, the context for this tragic story is the failure of the Darien Project combined with the secretive machinations of the Union negotiations.

Illustrated with two woodcuts of a man raising his glass and a woman dressed in her apron, this is a light-hearted ballad that muses on the belief that, for a marriage to succeed, the woman must have full control over what happens in the household. After outlining the thrust of his argument, the writer (most likely a male) then goes on to list a number of domestic episodes to show what works best in a marriage, in order to support his stated argument. Despite this amusing argument that the woman should 'wear the trousers' in a house, women hardly had any rights at all during this era. Consequently, it would be interesting to know what the female readership thought of this broadside.

The tale here is of a bridegroom who has run away from his bride on their wedding night without consummating the marriage. It appears that the bridegroom has been tricked into marriage before discovering that the bride's family has no money.

It is the women who are most praised in the piece: 'the Valiant Wives of Dyesart, / They ought to be Esteem'd', / They hasted fast down into the Shoar, / Our VICTAL to Redeem.'

This broadside contains an incongruous mix of ballads. The first is dedicated to celebrating the breathtaking beauty of a Scottish country lass, who is represented as being completely in tune with nature. The second ballad, however, is a political song supporting Home Rule for Ireland and, as such, eulogises the leader of the Home Rule Movement, Charles Stewart Parnell (1846-91), and his predecessor, Joseph Biggar.

This broadside ballad is dedicated to celebrating the beauty of a country lass. Given the simple theme of a beautiful, young country lass being completely in tune with the nature all around her, the ballad was probably written during the Romantic era, in the latter part of the eighteenth century. With regard to narrative, the ballad is structured around several episodes that occur as a result of a young gentleman's infatuation with the young woman.

This touching and heartfelt ballad is from the point of view of a mother who has received word that her son is dead. It appears that he was fighting in the Crimean War (1854-6), and was killed during the bombardment of Odessa. She is also grieving for her daughter, who died of a broken heart following the departure of her sweetheart - who is also fighting in the war. This ballad not only conveys the woman's tremendous sense of loss, it also highlights the futility of war and its full impact on the individuals involved.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites. The term 'ballad' eventually applied more broadly to any kind of topical or popular verse.","Broadside ballad entitled 'The Evils of War Or, The Ruined Family'",1854-1856
16856,ballad,L.C.Fol.178.A.2(216),"Verse 1: 'SAYS temperate Tam, the man of God, / The Disciple of Peace, / The Expounder of the holy word, / The Patriot's Babe of Grace, - ' Verse 2 'Says temperate Tam to silly Jack, / ""These oaths are all a sham, / But, lest your conscience it should ache, / We'll soothe it with a dram.""' No publication details are printed on the sheet, but a handwritten annotation has added '29 January 1835'.
This ballad appears to be a satire on the Temperance Movement. The word 'oaths' in verse 2 is probably a reference to the pledge signed in 1832 by a working class man from Preston, Joseph Livesy, and seven companions. The pledge stated that they would never drink alcohol again. The idea attracted other groups of working men, and in 1835 the British Association for the Promotion of Temperance was formed. The pledge became an important part of the Movement, but many early signatories interpreted it as referring only to spirit and continued to drink beer and wine. This hypocrisy forms the basis of the 'Epigram on Jock an' Tam'.

15122,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(129a),"This ballad begins: 'My father was an Irishman, / Born in sweet Kilkenny, / My mother was in England born, / In Linconshire so funny'. The sheet was published by the Poet's Box of Glasgow, and cost a penny.
This song of unity is about a man who has an English Mother and an Irish father, conceived on Scottish soil, but who was born at sea, on the way from Scotland to Ireland. It emphasises the interdependence of the three nations, exemplified in these lines from the final verse: 'May . . .The shamrock, rose and thistle too, Be blended all together'.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

14986,ballad,L.C.Fol.70(57b),"This ballad begins: 'My name is Duncan Campbell, from the shire of Argyle ; / I've travelled this country for many a long mile ; / I have travelled through England and Ireland and a', / And the name I go under is bold Erin-go-Bragh.' The sheet is undated and no publication details are given. A woodcut of a man, of Victorian appearance, adorns the top of the sheet.
For a long time in Scotland there was strong prejudice against Highlanders and Irishmen. Duncan Campbell is a Highland Scot, from Argyllshire, who, in Edinburgh, is mistaken for an Irishman. On account of this shared persecution, Campbell identifies with the Irish, and goes by the name 'Erin-go-bragh', which is a battlecry meaning 'Ireland Forever'. He ends up striking an indolent policeman and leaves the central belt and its prejudice.
This song was written in the nineteenth century, and the mention of the police puts it post-1829, when the 'Peelers' were first established.",Broadside ballad entitled 'Duncan Campbell',1880-1900

It was published on April 4th 1874.
The circus was very popular in late-Victorian times, and several songs appeared glorifying the various performers' exploits. This song, dedicated to Sophia, the tightrope walker, or 'funambulist', is very much of its time. Another, very famous circus-related song, is 'The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze', which was also written in the 1870s.

The 'Battle of Bonnymuir' occurred on 5th April 1820 near Bonnybridge, and was only one chapter in the 'Radical War'. At Bonnymuir, 19 Radicals were arrested and transported for conspiracy, treason and armed insurrection. The Radicals were campaigning for, amongst other economic and social changes, a wider enfranchisement of the population - this was eventually procured under the 1832 Reform Act. Another ballad entitled 'Bonnymuir' was written by a participant in the 1820 rising, Allan Barbour Murchie, who was imprisoned at Stirling Castle, along with 19 others. He was eventually transported and lived the rest of his life in Australia.

James Lindsay was a prolific broadside producer and many of his sheets are contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection. Most of them carry a woodcut illustration, although they vary greatly in quality and sophistication. Often on his sheets, short lyrics or flimsy content were compensated for by an elaborate illustration. Lindsay was probably aware that these pictures increased the perceived value.

A woodcut of a black woman carrying a basket and wearing European dress illustrates the top of the sheet. She is in a tropical setting as there is a palm tree behind her.
Not unusually, the woodcut used here bears no relation to the sheet's subject matter, the girl in question is dark haired, not dark skinned, and the tale is set in Glasgow, not the Pacific! The ballad is about a man who meets a pretty, but untrustworthy, girl. After handing over a forged note given to him by the girl, he is arrested and charged. This story is very similar to the traditional song 'The Black Velvet Band'.

This ballad is a boisterous drinking song, satirically dedicated to King George III (b. 1738-1820), who is informally referred to in the song as 'Geordie'. Drinking a toast to kings and queens (Hanoverian or Jacobite) was a highly contentious issue throughout the eighteenth century. The ballad celebrates the longevity of King George, though in a slightly ironic and non-deferential tone, and compares him favourably with Britain's main enemy at the time,  Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821). As the ballad is not openly critical of King George, it would have escaped being censored.

Below the title we are told that, 'Copies of this popular song can always be had at the POET'S BOX, Overgaie, Dundee'. The text underneath the title also states that the song was written by James Curran (a Glasgow song-writer and parodist), and sung by T. Barrick.
The bizarre lyrics to this ballad verge on the surreal. Supposedly based on the sensational stories that will be appearing in next week's edition of a newspaper called 'Police News', the song is comprised entirely of nonsense verses - though rather dark nonsense, admittedly. It seems likely that the reference to next week's police stories is a joke based on inside knowledge of the local crime scene. The trend for naming the songwriter and singer underneath the sheet's title could indicate that copyright laws had been introduced. It might also suggest that the shift towards music hall entertainment was now taking place.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers.

This charming song is written from the mother's perspective, as she patiently and tenderly tries to quieten down her rowdy children as they go to bed. Typically, as soon as the father returns home, the children behave. The song ends with the mother's heartfelt wish that God protect the children, even in their old age, 'when their pows be bauld'.

This tender ballad describes a woman's love for her sweetheart, who is a shepherd. The celebration of a pure, healthy country lifestyle was a common feature not only of the ballads, but also of the work of great Scottish poets like Ramsay, Fergusson and Burns. It was a particular concern in the later eighteenth century as industrialisation and urbanisation increasingly affected the Scottish landscape. However, the shepherd as a symbol of gentleness and humility long predates this era and is found most famously in the bible.

This is a comic ballad in rhyming Scots couplets. The humour is based around a minster who comes to pray for 'David', believing him to be 'Cuddy Peggy's sick husband when 'David' is in fact her horse. The minister's role as community leader has featured in Scottish literature for centuries, sometimes in a heroic light, sometimes as a target of satire. Here the minister is gently ridiculed but ultimately portrayed in a good light, as he laughs 'a' the road hame' at his own mistake.

The Poet's Box was a loose business organisation, which enabled poets to published their work quickly and cheaply, even if anonymously. The Poet's Box in Dundee, produced a prolific amount of literature, some of which was copied from other areas, and some of which travelled to other areas itself. Dundee during the nineteenth century enjoyed a busy dockside trade. As a result travelling and shipping feature quite heavily in the local literature.

This melancholic ballad tells the unhappy story of the death of a baby. As you would expect of such a song of mourning, the tone of this ballad is lyrical rather than sentimental - especially in the second verse, when the baby's death is finally revealed. The second verse moves location from the cradle to the grave, and the writer skilfully employs the natural image of the weeping willow to reinforce the pain and grief that exists in this song of lamentation. Many broadside ballads such as this one are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

'The Cow and the Parson' is a satirical ballad about Jem, an innocent young man who loses his cow and climbs a tree to look for it. From the tree he sees a parson seducing a young woman. The parson, on discovering that he has been spotted, buys Jem's silence with a purse full of gold.  'The Star of Glengary' is quite different in tone. It is a romantic, sentimental tribute from a husband to his wife of many years.
This broadside was probably sold for a penny or a penny and a half. The inclusion of two ballads, and a woodcut illustration, would probably have led to it being considered very good value at the time of its publication. Broadsides usually contained only one song or story and often featured little or no decoration.",Broadside ballads entitled 'The Cow and the Parson!' and 'The Star of Glengary',1850-1870
14782,ballad,L.C.Fol.178.A.2(027),"This ballad begins: 'You married men, I pray, come listen to my lay, / I will tell you the truth if I can; / You will by what I say, if attention you pay, / That a woman is the plague of a man.' It was published by James Lindsay of 9 King Street, Glasgow, and probably sold for a penny.
In this comic ballad, women are accused in the most disparaging of terms of being the relentless tormentors of man. Although the author redeems himself slighty in the final verse, by suggesting that 'There is nothing through life like a good-tempered wife', all in all he presents a pretty damning portrait of womankind. Women were often vilified in the street literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Whilst much of it was presented in a humorous tone, it does highlight the prejudicial and negative attitudes towards women that pervaded society at this time.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing.

This ballad appears to be little more than a misogynist rant - although it could be intended as ironic. However, it does at least reveal much about the nature of society at the time, and how women were still tainted with causing the 'the Fall', our banishment from Eden and the subsequent concept of original sin. The anonymous writer does tone down his invective in the last verse, however, when he concedes that a sober wife is acceptable. The advertisement at the bottom of this sheet is especially interesting, as it gives a good illustration of the diversity that a broadside publisher could offer the public.

The broadside was published by the Poet's Box, 182 Overgate, Dundee. At the foot of the sheet a mail order service for songs is advertised.
This ballad draws on familiar Scottish themes for its story and its humour. It is narrated by a man who is seduced by an attractive woman and by his own weakness for drink, and who is then robbed by the woman after the drink has sent him to sleep. The punchline is that although the woman has stolen his 'siller' or money, she has at least left him ' a wee drappie mair'.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

This grotesque comic ballad is about a barber who uses a broken, rusty razor on any customers who request a shave on credit. One of the notable aspects of the ballad is its portrayal of an Irish customer, using a transcription of an exaggerated Irish accent and various stereotypical phrases such as 'O, by japers', and referring to the customer as 'Paddy' throughout. Anti-Irish satire and propaganda had been common in British society for many years but probably worsened during the nineteenth century because of the Irish struggle for home rule and increasing numbers of Irish workers coming to Britain.

The narrator of this ballad mentions many of his friends, such as 'Dominic Davie' and 'Robin the ploughman', singing the praises of each of them. It is a simply structured piece, consisting of ten quatrains with an A-A-B-B rhyming structure. No tune is given, although it would almost certainly have been sung to an old, popular air.

Two days of court proceedings have been recorded. The first day covered mainly thefts and most of the convictions resulted in 7 years' transportation. The second day was devoted to solely one case, the murder by John Stewart of his wife, Christian. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to hang. The end of the report reminds readers that pleading insanity will no longer be a convenient way for criminals to extricate themselves from these situations.

Below this prologue, is the introduction to a story about the loss of a packet ship called 'Boston', which was struck by lightning and sunk with all hands. Although the date of publication and name of the publisher are not included, the story was sourced from 'The Courant' newspaper - probably the Edinburgh Courant, published 1855-1859.
This broadside tells the tragic story of a woman who, it is claimed, murdered a newly-born baby in a quarry near Musselburgh Links. The details to this story are rather sketchy, with the investigation into the infant's violent death very much at an early stage. Judging by the reference to the workhouse in Edinburgh, the woman, who was reported to be either deranged or under the influence of drink, would certainly have been a pauper. Although this woman appears to be the main suspect, it is interesting to note that a group of gypsies who were camped nearby to the murder scene were moved on by the authorities.

This sheet was published by the Edinburgh printer John Campbell.
The first story reports the murder of Mrs Calderhead by two unnamed fellows, whilst the details of the murder could not be revealed for decency's sake. Not a lot of facts have been given here, but then this could be a fairly early report, close after the incident. The second story, also lacking in facts, reveals how an older woman was burned to death. Both these incidents occurred during the revelries of New Year, which the text itself points out can be quite rowdy in Scotland. They were written during a period when society was preoccupied with the link between poverty and class, and how this could be improved through self-discipline, self-denial and religion.

Joseph MacWilliam was a gentleman's servant who rented a cellar in Rose Street, Edinburgh to live in. He was regularly the butt of his colleagues' and neighbours' jokes. They claimed to have seen him in the same threadbare clothes for 15 years and that he lived in damp and Spartan conditions. Upon searching his property after the accident over £8,000 was found. Some of this was in the form of property deeds, while more of it was in bank receipts. There was, however, very little else in the room itself. It would be curious to know then how he burnt to death!
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

This account was sourced from the 'Ayr Advertiser'.
According to this account, the tragic loss of the Minerva of Leith resulted in the deaths of five individuals: a crewman named Peter Porter and four passengers. Although the synopsis at the top of the sheet suggests that only three passengers lost their lives, this information is contradicted in the main report. Inaccuracies such as this were common in broadsides. In order to provide the reader with news that was current, broadside producers had to work extremely fast.

This ballad tells the story of a ship's passengers resorting to cannibalism after being marooned by a storm. Despite very specific details of the ship's name and passage being mentioned in the song, it is difficult to find records that will verify whether or not it is based in fact.

The tragedy described in this report occurred on Sunday 15th June 1828, in Kirkcaldy Parish Church, which later became known as St Brycedale's. Later reports suggested that twenty-eight people were killed and more than one hundred injured when part of a crowded public gallery gave way. The congregation was apparently swollen because of a guest sermon from 'Rev. Mr Irving' . This is probably a reference to Edward Irving (1792-1834), a famous evangelical Church of Scotland minister who worked in Kirkcaldy before taking up a post in London in 1822.

However, Carnegie of Finhaven, the man whose blow killed the Earl, was tried for his murder in a famous trial. Defended by Robert Dundas, the case became famous not only for its sensational content, but also because it resumed the right of Scottish juries to 'judge a case not only by the naked facts, but of the facts and the law conjunctively'.

The first Tay Bridge, designed by Thomas Bouch (1822-90), was completed in 1878. After the collapse of the bridge, as described in the preface to this ballad, a public enquiry found Bouch's design to blame for the disaster, maintaining that it was not adequate to withstand strong winds. The tragedy inspired various songs and poems, most famously William McGonagall's (c.1825-1902) 'The Tay Bridge Disaster'. McGonagall claimed that 'ninety lives have been taken away', while this broadside puts the figure at sixty. It is now believed that seventy-five lives were lost in the disaster.

The broadside was published by Menzies of the Lawnmarket in Edinburgh, and the story was sourced from the Observer newspaper.
The loss of the Amphitrite had a big impact on the British public. The tone of this report reflects the sympathy and anger that was felt at such a loss of life and implies suspicion that proper safety procedures may not have been observed because the ship carried convicts rather than passengers: 'The British public demands that an inquiry be instituted into the conduct of all the parties concerned in this deplorable affair'. This was one of the first major losses of a convict ship bound for Australasia, but within two years two more vessels, the 'George III' and the 'Neva' had also sunk with major losses of life.

Using an eye witness report, this broadside dramatically tells the story of a massive fire that destroyed mills and residential buildings at the Shore in Leith, Edinburgh. This report is very similar in style and tone to contemporary newspaper accounts of fires and accidents. The immediacy of the broadside is also interesting, in the way it relates to the fire that took place 'this morning'. According to the Gentleman's Magazine for 1 January 1833, this fire took place on 29 December 1832. Clearly, the street-criers and ballad-singers would have great difficulty in selling broadsides that contained old news.

The incident reported here is not at all well-known in Scotland today, but had circumstances been different it might be remembered as one of the worst transport disasters ever to befall the country. All the passengers aboard the burning steamer 'Ben Lomond' were rescued by local fishermen from Cramond on the Firth of Forth. Steam cruises on the Forth-Clyde canal and in the Firths of Forth and Clyde were highly popular in the nineteenth century.

The broadside publisher was Menzies, and the story was sourced from the Northampton Herald.
Wombwell's Travelling Menagerie was founded in the early nineteenth century by George Wombwell (1777-1850), a London businessman who had been acquiring and showing exotic animals for some years. Wallace the Lion, one of the assailants mentioned in this broadside report, was the first lion to be born in Britain. Wombwell named him after William Wallace, the champion of Scottish independence. Although the report was sourced in England, the menagerie visited Scotland annually and there would have been great interest in this bizarre tragedy north of the border. Wallace had actually been involved in an arranged fight in Warwick with 6 dogs in August 1825, for which Wombwell was severely criticized on the grounds of cruelty.

The report has been taken from the Edinburgh Courant newspaper and published by John Campbell, Edinburgh. The 'Czar' went down in 1831.
Below the story of the 'Czar' are a few more tales of death and destruction, always popular with the readers! The sheet must have been published in the winter as the stories relate to cold-weather problems. Firstly , there is a story about a coal-hewer who died after getting lost in snow. In Fife, it is reported that 11 people died in the snow. Finally, a report of another shipwreck, this time at Leith. All perished.

As with the newspapers of today, broadsides were extremely timely. Competition between publishers was so fierce that each tried to bring people news almost as it was happening. This broadside appeared only a few hours after a fire raged through two tenements and a number of shops in Edinburgh's Cowgate. Given the time of the fire, around one o'clock in the morning, and the overcrowded nature of tenements at this time, it is quite remarkable that only three people died in the blaze.

The publisher of the broadside is not noted, but its source is given as the 'Caledonian Mercury'. The sheet was priced at one penny.
The broadside refers to a fire at 55 Upper Harley Street, London, that claimed the life of Lord Walsingham at the age of 55. Contemporary sources, including this report taken from the 'Caledonian Mercury', report that George de Grey, the third Lord Walsingham (1776-1831), and his wife Matilda Methuen both died as a consequence of the fire in the early hours of 27 April 1831. An inquest which took place later that day concluded that the deaths of the deceased had been 'caused accidentally and by misfortune'. It was subsequently revealed that Lord Walsingham had been in poor health and on medication, and may not have been in a fit state to save himself when the fire broke out in his bedroom.

The sheet was priced at one penny and was published by Robert McMillan. The place of publication is not noted.
The gunpowder works at Stobsmills were founded in the late eighteenth century, around the same time that the village of Gorebridge began to grow up around the new bridge over the Gore Water in Midlothian. Despite the severity of the damage caused in this explosion in 1825, production continued at the the gunpowder works until 1875. Today Gorebridge exists primarily as a residential area for Edinburgh commuters.

This story was sourced from the 'Edinburgh Observer' of Tuesday 23rd February, 1841. A sketchy woodcut of a boat has been included.
Newspapers although extant at the time, enjoyed only a limited readership, mainly due to their cost. Their content, however, was often of a more diverse and international nature than broadside reporters could source. As a result articles were often copied from the newspapers onto single sheets to be sold as broadsides. This kept publishers' costs down but increased their revenue exponentially. This was possible at the time as copyright laws were only in their infancy, although situations such as this probably contributed to tightening them up.

Although no publication details are included, the reference to the late Lord Eldon suggests the sheet was published in, or around, 1838.
Picardy Place, which is in the centre of Edinburgh, is the location where this tragic accident took place. Although the attention-grabbing headline suggests that this was a major disaster, there was only one fatality, a banker called Alexander Smith. However, the sheet also contains an extensive list of those who were injured, including many members of genteel Edinburgh society. As an 'Old Tory' MP and Lord Chancellor, John Scott, Lord Eldon (1751-1838) was an important figure in Georgian public life, and was famous for drafting the Regency bill of 1788 and for opposing political reform. The National Library of Scotland's collection contains another broadside that also describes this tragic accident.

The publisher was William Robertson, the 'Flying Stationer', of Edinburgh.
The 'Comet', designed by Henry Bell (1767-1830) from Helensburgh and built in 1811, was the world's first successfully operational passenger steamship. An earlier Scottish steam vessel, the Charlotte Dundas, had been withdrawn because it had caused too much damage to the Forth and Clyde canal. Initially the 'Comet' operated only in the Firth of Clyde, but after being lengthened it was switched to the route between Inverness and Glasgow. The original 'Comet' was wrecked on rocks off Oban in 1820, and it was the replacement vessel that sank with many losses of life in 1825, as described in this broadside.
The 'flying stationer' referred to in the imprint was another name for a seller or hawker of broadsides and chapbooks. 'Walking stationer' and 'Running stationer' were other terms used.

Despite the dramatic headline and sensationalist tone of this broadside, fortunately, only one life was lost during the collapse of the auction room building. In fact, much of the broadside is dedicated to the memory of the one man who was killed, and it often reads like an obituary column from a newspaper. Its text-heavy nature suggests that it may have been aimed at the upper classes, a point supported by the list of honourable ladies and gentlemen who were injured.

The Scot James Watt (1736-1819) revolutionised the steam engine by inventing the separate condenser in 1769, which made steam-powered ships viable. Steam ships were developed in America and Europe throughout the 1780s and 1790s, but the world's first successful passenger steamer was the 'Comet', built and launched in 1812 by another Scot, Henry Bell (1767-1830). Early steamers were quite prone to accidents, as the report shown suggests. The 'Lady of the Lake', which sank off Tarbet, was launched in 1815 and was probably the first Clyde steamer to be named after one of Sir Walter Scott's works. Several other steamers would subsequently take their names from Scott.

Very little contextual information has been included on this sheet, which reinforces the fact the these sheets were the ephemeral notices and information of their day.

Further information on Commissioner Kello is, unfortunately, not easily traceable. The fact that his name and date of death is recorded suggests that he may have been well known at the time, although these sheets also functioned as a means of entertainment.

Anne Douglas-Hamilton, 1st Duchess of Hamilton, was born in 1632, to the 1st Duke of Hamilton and his wife. She was the only child to survive her father and eventually became duchess in her own right when her uncle, the 2nd Duke of Hamilton, died heir-less. A formidable and energetic woman, Anne engineered the successful petition for her husband, William Douglas, to be given the Hamilton title. She was responsible for building Hamilton Palace, although she was evicted from this home by Oliver Cromwell. Anne died in 1716, just months after visiting her second favourite residence at Strathaven, Lanarkshire.

Whilst numerous elegies were published lamenting the deaths of such high-profile figures as kings and queens, politicians and national heroes, this broadside indicates that elegies for lesser-known local figures also proved popular amongst the public.

The additional text at the bottom of the sheet begins: 'Old Sathan, England's Friend, Our Foe, / Contriv'd BELHAVEN's Overthrow'.
The Scottish statesman John, Lord Belhaven is perhaps best remembered for a rousing speech he made to the Scottish parliament in 1706, denouncing the prospect of a union with the English parliament. Despite his protests, and those of many others, the Act of Union was passed the following year. Belhaven is also known to have had interests in the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies, founded in 1695. They were responsible for the disastrous Darien Scheme (1698-9), which heightened tensions with England and left Scotland financially crippled.

A note at the foot of this sheet states it was 'Printed for the Stationers' in Edinburgh.
This ballad is a song of mourning that pays tribute to a Scotsman called Sandy McKay (or M'Kay).  He was a Scottish heavyweight boxer called Alexander 'Sandy' McKay who, tragically, died in the ring while fighting the champion, Simon Byrne, at Salcey Green, Northamptonshire, in June 1830. This was the second meeting between M'Kay and Byrne - the former had lost the first bout. Byrne was tried and acquitted for the Scot's death. Byrne from Dublin was also to die 'in the ring' after a fight with James 'Deaf' Burke in June 1833.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing.

A commemorative note below the title states that Willy Bald was a 'Porter in Traquaire'.
Written in a mock-epic style that suggests it was published during the eighteenth century, this ballad is a song of mourning for a porter called Willy Bald, who lived in Traquair, Peeblesshire. The historical town of Traquair is famous for its breweries and the ballad certainly highlights the fact that Willy was fond of his drink. Indeed, the author plays on the humorous concept that Willy will suffer a terrible drought if he ends up in Hell - hence the prayer at the end. Although Willy was not of the highest social class, the ballad celebrates his self-taught erudition and free-thinking philosophy, thereby suggesting he is a man of the Scottish Enlightenment.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to say whether Captain George Drummond was in any way related to the celebrated George Drummond (1687-1766), who was appointed Edinburgh's Lord Provost in 1725. Both men appear to have had a great concern for and genuine interest in the less fortunate members of society. Whilst this elegy talks of Captain Drummond's charity and clemency, Provost Drummond is best remembered for initiating a groundbreaking programme of public works and for establishing the Royal Infirmary.

Another elegy was written for him by Alexander Pennecuik (1652-1722), the burgess bard of Edinburgh, and Nisbet had further volumes of poetry dedicated to his memory.

The elegy begins: 'Still we do find, Black Cloth wears out the first, / And Fruits that are the choicest keep the worst'. The elegy was composed by William Gibson. The epitaph at the bottom of the sheet begins: 'Here Meekness lies interr'd with Wisdom's Light, / Zeal with Charity, a Pastor shining bright'.
Whilst a number of broadsides include a small woodcut illustration at the top of the sheet, adding to the visual appeal, this elegy contains an unusually high degree of illustrative detail. The top of the sheet shows a skull and crossbones along with the Latin phrase 'memento mori' (remember you must die), and the text is bordered on both sides by the image of the crossbones, a skeleton, and two crossed spades. Wilson must have been a prominent figure to warrant this rather ornate form of remembrance.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century.

The poem was written by 'A Countryman' and would have cost a penny to buy. It carries a woodcut profile of Burke at the top of the sheet.
There are many elegies contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection, which cover a vast range of characters. This man, however, was infamous at the time of his death due to the outrage caused by his murders, which were solely for profit. Some of these other broadsides describe his last morning and death throes on the gallows in great detail. Alongside this broadside is a newspaper cutting from a Sheffield paper concerning the Burke and Hare case and a advertisement for a publication on the case.
Burke and Hare were Irish bodysnatchers and murderers, who worked around Edinburgh's Canongate area - eventually becoming local legends. They hit upon the idea of murdering vulnerable or solitary people (in an attempt not to get caught) so that they could sell the bodies for dissection. Hare turned King's Evidence and so was acquitted, but this secured the conviction of Burke, who was hanged on the 28th January 1829.",Broadside entitled 'Elegy',1829

With a Caution to his Successors.' The elegy begins: 'AND has Old Death that Bloody Knave'.
Many of the people featured on broadsides were once local celebrities, but are now largely untraceable. Often the only available personal information is contained within the broadside. Here, however, much is revealed about Whetty's lifestyle and social status.
Whetty was a tailor, mainly involved in the production of parliamentary gowns. He was also a goat-herd and a 'penny-weddings' organiser. Further to this, his successors are warned that they will have a hard job filling Whetty's shoes.",Broadside entitled 'Elegy',1720

There are other elegies upon the death of surgeons contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection. It is curious to note, however, that the title on this sheet is identical to most of the other sheets praising surgeons. This illustrates the speed and financial ethic which drove this industry. It would seem that the printer kept a plate made up and simply changed the name and verse for each new commission.

There are many elegies contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection, although most of them seem to be written about people who are now virtually untraceable. The local surgeon would have been a well-known member of the community, given his status and the fact that he mixed with all classes. As a result, a broadside not only featuring him but praising him may have been a more appealing purchase.

It is now difficult to trace many of the people featured in broadside elegies - often the only personal information available on them is contained in the broadside. Here it would appear that Colonel Sara was infamous for her political opinions and her charitable work. It is more than likely, given the function of broadsides, that Colonel Sara would have enjoyed local celebrity status. Because of it's topicality and local interest it may have sold well.

The poem begins: 'O! Thou my Muse, that's now Bedew'd with Tears, / Sob thou Dire Sighs, Pierce Adamantine Ears'.
John Murray, Lord Bowhill, is described as a 'senator of the College of Justice', which is the full title of a judge in Scots law. The College of Justice was founded in Edinburgh in 1532 and was one of the Scottish institutions to retain its independence after the Treaty of Union in 1707. Murray's elegist clearly held him in very high esteem and crafted his poem very carefully. Its words praise Murray extravagantly, and the final ten lines are designed as an acrostic verse, where the initial letters of each line spell the subject's name when read from top to bottom.

Aged 28 Years.' The elegy begins: 'O Great, eternal, high and mighty One, / Who doth command all Flesh before thy Throne'. Although no publication date has been included on this broadside, it was most likely issued the same year as Delape's death.
As with many of the elegies in the National Library of Scotland's broadside collection, the individual whose passing is being mourned here has, with the passing of years, disappeared into obscurity. At the time this broadside was written, William Delape was obviously a well-known figure around Edinburgh. Many people would have bought this elegy having known the man personally, or at least known of him. To a twenty-first century audience, however, his memory is no longer still alive.

In Febr 1710. With Brief Description of his Penitentials.' The elegy begins: 'O Fatal Death! Thou many Methods take, / Poor Man to Kill, and Mortal Hearts still breaks'.
Also included on this sheet is a short verse detailing the 'Huy and Cry after the Murderers of William Rue'. It begins: 'There is George Ballantine, the Young Laird of Craigmuir / Chief Murderer, who thinks himself secure'. Unfortunately there is no information included regarding the author or publisher.
This elegy follows a familiar pattern found in many broadsides of the day. It details the tragic murder of a god-fearing and morally-upstanding young man. His piety is considered exemplary and is intended to serve as a lesson to the readership. It is possible that this broadside was one of a sequence detailing the incidents surrounding the death of Rue. It appears, from the final verse, that whilst the identities of the murderers were known, they had yet to be apprehended.",Broadside entitled 'Elegie',1710
15574,elegies,Ry.III.c.36(001),"This memorial notice begins: ON the Death of his Grace JOHN DUKE of ROTHES, LORD High CHANCELLOUR of SCOTLAND, &c. ELEGIE.' The elegy which follows begins: 'ISRAEL for Moses fourty days did Mourn, / Our Joy to Grief, twice fourty days may turn; / Scotlands Conductor, ROTHES, Wise and Brave, / Ah! Now Himself Conducted is to Grave'. The publication date of this broadside is not given, but it is likely to have been published some time in 1681, as the subject died on 27th July 1681.
John Leslie (c.1630-81), 7th Earl of Rothes, remained faithful to the House of Stuart during the civil war of the seventeenth century, and after the restoration of Charles II he was richly rewarded for his loyalty. In 1660 he was appointed President of the Privy Council of Scotland and in 1661 Lord High Chancellor of Scotland for Life. In 1680 he was created 1st Duke of Rothes. On his death the Duke was awarded a state funeral. His loyalty and accomplishments are lavishly praised in the elegy on this broadside.

The elegy begins: 'THE Defunct has obtain'd a Name, / By virtue of the Doctor's Fame'. As mentioned in the title, William Mitchell was a 'Tinclarian Doctor'. 'Tinclarian' is a Scots word meaning 'tinker-like'.
According to this elegy, Janet Hill was the wife of William Mitchell, a charlatan who set himself up as a doctor despite his lack of formal training. Although Janet is described as 'The Honest Woman all the while, / Who at such mad Attempts did smile, / Behav'd her self without all Guile', it appears that she was driven by her desire for money and, as such, aided him in his work. Charlatans such as Mitchell were a common feature of the eighteenth century. With medical science still in its relative infancy and most doctors charging exorbitant prices, often the only avenue open to the poor and sick was to call upon the slighty cheaper services of the 'tinclarian'.

The name 'N. Paterson' is given at the foot of the sheet. This may refer to the author of the elegy, or it could refer to the broadside publisher.
Margaret Leslie, the sister of John Leslie, 7th Earl and 1st Duke of Rothes, married David, 2nd Earl of Wemyss in 1652. After David died in 1679 their daughter Margaret (d. 1705) became legal Countess of Wemyss, although the dedication on this elegy suggests that the elder Margaret could also continue to use the title. Both the Leslie and Wemyss families were staunch supporters of the House of Stuart and the intermarriage may have been as much for political as for romantic reasons. The National Library of Scotland also holds a broadside elegy on John Leslie.

' Althought the publication date of the broadside is not given, it is likely to have been shortly after the death of the subject on March 6th, 1698.
The subject of this elegy, William Lindsay (1644-98), was the 18th Earl of Crawford. He was also the second Earl of Lindsay, the title having been created for his father John (c.1598-1678) in 1633. The Lindsays of Crawford had been influential in Scottish politics and society since the 12th century, and during the civil wars of the 17th century John Lindsay wavered between supporting the Covenanters and the Royalists. William Lindsay consistently supported the Covenanters, and this benefited him when James II was deposed and William and Mary became monarchs. In the elegy, William is described as 'a Pillar of the Church, Supporter of the Crown'.

Whilst Alexander, Lord Reath appears to have been a highly respected and prominent figure during his lifetime, his name has been somewhat forgotten with the passing of years. It is apparent from this elegy mourning Reath's death that he served king and country well, and was eventually awarded the honour of 'Hye Keeper of SCOTLAND'. Although little is known of Reath himself, it can be said with surety that he lived during troubled times. With the Union of the Crowns in 1603, the seventeenth century was a time of great religious and political upheaval.

John Pringle, Piper of Lauder, is a fairly well-known songwriter and musician of the eighteenth century. Apart of the works he is now alleged to have composed, as many of them appeared anonymously at the time, very little else is known about him. Pipers and musicians in general, however, were valued and respected members of their communities as testified by the life's of Niel Gow and Habbie Simpson.

Although no publication details are included on the sheet, it must have been published shortly after the 16th of October, 1711, which is the date when Adam Brown died.
With religious imagery from the Old Testament dominating throughout, this elegy reveals as much about the God-fearing nature of Scottish society in 1711, as it does of Adam Brown's life and death. Indeed, the writer uses the name 'Adam' to provide him with an interesting angle for his elegy, as he commences his lines with the arrival of death following Adam and Eve's original sin and subsequent banishment from Eden. As there is not much information about Adam Brown's life in Edinburgh, it could be that his place in history was eclipsed by Auld Reekie's stunning reinvention as 'the Athens of the North' during the Scottish Enlightenment and Georgian period. 'Auld Reekie' and 'Athens of the North' are respective nicknames for Edinburgh.

It is now difficult to know whether 'John Couper the kirk treasurer' was ever a real person, as no concrete details are given in the text and he is now largely untraceable. The text does talk about John Couper's deeds but it also goes on to rant about the excesses of churchmen in general. They are accused of spending money on hackney cabs, women and fine ornaments, and only giving spare money to the poor!

It was published by R. Cobban & Co. Aberdeen, in 1830.
Despite the brevity of many broadsides, they often reflect a great deal about the society in which they were produced. Note here for example, that although the broadside is written in English, the murderer addresses the crowd at his execution in Gaelic. In 1830 the Highlands were predominantly Gaelic-speaking. Broadsides would not have been written in Gaelic, however, as the language was rarely written and very few were able to read or write it. The translation of Hugh Macleod's last words suggest that author of this broadsheet, as well as being literate in English, is likely to have been bilingual in English and Gaelic.

Broadside reports vary greatly in the amount of information they provide. This example gives an unusually full account of the condemned woman's life and actions, from her previous homes and marriage, through her work selling pottery in an unhappy second marriage, to her murder of that second husband and her subsequent attempts to starve herslf to death before she could be executed. The execution itself is described in minute, pathetic detail. It appears that the author of this broadside is keen to elict sympathy for Elizabeth McNiel.

Illustrated with rather frightening woodcuts, this broadside tells of a murder of a young woman perpetrated by two carters from Gilmerton, John Thomson and David Dobie, and the subsequent execution of the two condemned prisoners. Highlighting the men's 'very rude and ill-behaved' manner before and after the trial, the report contrasts their loutish behaviour with the calm demeanour that resulted after they had made their peace with God. The last paragraph describes the prisoners' behaviour on the scaffold, while the final sentence closes the subject by mentioning that the bodies of the murderers are now being dissected at the college.

This is one in a series of broadsides kept by the National Library of Scotland which relate to this case. A week prior to his execution, Robert Emond was convicted of murdering his wife's sister and her teenage daughter. Apparently, Emond's wife and Mrs Franks had chastised him for speculating too much with the family's money, and Emond's 'bewildered mind' believed he was utterly despised by them. So, after a blazing row with his wife, he killed her sister and niece at their home.

Both these men were tried a month before their execution at the High Court in Edinburgh, and there are other broadsides covering their cases contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection. They were convicted of the murder of the church elder, John McClure. This execution notice follows a fairly standard pattern describing their application for reprieve, their sober behaviour as death became imminent and their 'advice' to others to repent of their ways. A strong theme amongst broadsides of the time - the evils of drink - is also highlighted by this report.

Publisher William Johnston, Edinburgh, 1823
One of the most interesting elements of this broadside is the emphasis that is placed on the great ceremony surrounding the execution. This perhaps reflects the fact that the murder and subsequent execution took place in a rural community, where such events would have been rare. An execution probably had greater impact as a spectacle, and a warning, for the people of Roxburghshire and Berwickshire than it would have had for the people of Edinburgh.

Thomas Black was executed in Libberton Wynd, Edinburgh, which was located in almost the same place as the modern day junction of the High Street and George IV Bridge.

Contained on this broadside is an evocative report of the last hours of William Burke. Burke and his colleague William Hare were responsible for sixteen murders, motivated by the money they could earn by selling the bodies on to anatomists at Edinburgh's medical school. Hare saved himself from the gallows by agreeing to give evidence against Burke. As the report describes, Burke's execution was a popular spectacle in a city angered by the pair's crimes, and at the scaffold many shouted for Hare to be hanged also.

There are other reports of this case contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection. Many of these reports, however, took on a standard format to speed up the production process. Often, only the relevant details such as name, crime and date were changed. Normally the convicts did not sleep the night before, they received the clergymen with quiet humility and then their deaths were used as a vehicle of moral warning. Here, however, there is also a short description of Macdonald's dying throes for those looking for grim entertainment.

This sheet was published in Aberdeen, on Saturday 24th May 1823.
This style of sentimentalised and sensational reporting is one of the features which makes broadsides the forerunner of modern newspapers. There is a great emphasis on religion in this text, with the young men regretting their neglect of the Sabbath and the Scriptures. The three men's sober behaviour and self-control are also highlighted in favourable terms. These characteristics would eventually became the cornerstone of Victorian society.

Unfortunately no publication details are given.
Heaman, who is reported here to be an Englishman (although other reports suggest he was Swedish), and Gautiez, a Frenchman, were convicted of piracy and murder at the High Court of Admiralty in Edinburgh. It is the only capital conviction for a crime beyond Scottish shores. They were hanged within the flood-mark on Leith Sands, opposite the Royal Naval Dockyard.

It was published in Edinburgh for R. Forrest and sold for one penny.
Thomas Black and his accomplice, John Reid, were both tried for breaking into the house of Mr Alexander White of South Leith and stealing a number of his possessions. The jury found them both guilty, but on account of their youth recommended them to mercy. The judge, meanwhile, having no such consideration for their fate, sentenced both young men to be executed. Whilst Reid received a reprieve soon after, Black was executed for the crime of housebreaking.
The many crime reports that form part of the National Library of Scotland's broadside collection offer a fascinating insight into crime and punishment in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Scotland. Whilst the penalty of death might appear unusually harsh in the case of Thomas Black, execution was in fact a common punishment for housebreaking and theft at this time.",Broadside entitled 'Execution',1823

The sheet was printed by Menzies of Edinburgh.
Wemyss and his wife, Sally McRavey, who had once been tinkers, had settled in Plainstane Close, Edinburgh. However, they were prone to drinking and it is while both were arguing and in a 'state of beastly intoxication' that Wemyss murdered his wife. He then put her to bed and made his escape. He was caught soon after, tried and condemned. He was around 40 years old.
Although this report only hints at it, the executioner, John Scott, made a mistake in his first attempt at the drop. He didn't take the correct bolt out, much to the crowd's horror. An official noticed and soon Wemyss was 'launched into eternity'.",Broadside entitled 'Execution',1840

It was published by Sanderson of Edinburgh's High Street in 1835.
Irishman Bell had shot his Sergeant-Major, after he had been refused leave. It is reported that Bell was very repentant for his crime, 'paying particular ttention to the religious instructions communicated to him by the Rev. Mr Hunter of the Tron Church'. The Tron Church is still standing, just off the Royal Mile, in Hunter Square. Presumably named after this same Reverend Hunter.

This sheet mainly deals with the time between the sentencing of Stuart and Wright and their execution, and the National Library of Scotland holds another broadside detailing the offence and trial. It was very common for a series of broadsides to be printed which followed the development of a particular case. This generally involved a report on the crime itself, the apprehension of the suspects, the trial and sentencing, the execution and, finally, the last words.

It was published by John Muir of Glasgow. Wear and tear on this broadside makes some words quite difficult to read.
The condemned woman was found guilty of poisoning two people in the village of Carluke, for no obvious motive other than that she owed one of them five pounds. It is believed that she might have got away with her crimes had she not insisted on suspiciously quick burials for the victims. The broadside author notes that an unsuccessful appeal against the execution was made by 'a few Quakers and other eccentric individuals'. The tone suggests that the author was a keen supporter of capital punishment. Elizabeth Jeffrey was executed on May 21, 1838 for poisoning two people in Carluke.

The sheet was published by William Carse, who is listed as working from various addresses in Glasgow between 1820 and 1836.
This broadside describes an execution of two servant girls at Kilmainham Jail, Dublin, who were sentenced to death for murdering their former mistress. With both of the accused poverty-stricken, it seems that the motive for the murder was one of financial gain - with which they would then flee to England. Certainly, the terrible violence of the attack is completely out of proportion to the stated aim of robbery. The report ends with a stern warning to servants, advising them to beware of jealousy and ill-will.

Chorus: 'O waes me, / My days do wear awa'; / I wish I were but free again / From the hangman's fa'.' This song was written by John McLean, a coalminer.
John Mclean's ballad is based on a real case. On August 3rd 1835 Elizabeth McNeil or Banks was hanged in Edinburgh for poisoning her husband Peter Banks with arsenic. Contemporary reports of the crime reveal that Peter Banks, a collier, was an abusive man, but also record that Elizabeth Banks had repeatedly stated that she would one day be executed. This unusual fact is referred to in verse four of the ballad.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

Conner (or Connor) and McMenemy were executed at Jail Square, which was located in the Saltmarket area of Glasgow, for the assault and robbery of Alexander McKinnon. Their executioner was Thomas Young, who was hangman in Glasgow and elsewhere between 1815 and 1834. According to A.F. Young in 'The encyclopaedia of Scottish executions 1750-1963' (1988), McMenemy was the first woman to be hanged in Glasgow since Agnes White, who was executed in 1793 for poisoning her five-month old child.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century.

A different elegy, 'by another hand' is given below. It begins 'An has ald Death come in his Rage, / Cut Hary's Breath, and aff the Stage'. There are no publication details given.
Probably written around 1720, the tone of the first elegy is respectful, although the second author seems to have had a more personal relationship with the executioner. The National Library of Scotland also holds broadsides concerning the next two Edinburgh hangmen, Sutherland and John Daglees or Dalgleish. Sutherland, mentioned in this piece, was banished in 1722. Dalgleish died around 1730.

14616,executions,F.3.a.13(76),"This memorial notice begins: 'Elegy and Epitaph on Thomas Williams, Late Dempster, or Hangman, of the City of Edinburgh'. The dedication under the title begins: 'Who died the 5th of January 1833, aged 66 years. He was upwards of 12 years in that capacity, and conducted himself with wonderful propriety, which few does in his line. This shows, that whatever occupation in life we follow, a man may keep his character somewhat blameless.' The first line of the elegy itself reads, 'SCARCE had the infant year begun', while the opening line of the epitaph reads, 'HERE lies TAM WILLIAMS, our city Dempster'. A 'dempster' was a legal officer who repeated the sentence after the judge.
This broadside contains a song of mourning dedicated to the memory of Thomas Williams, who worked as a hangman - or doomster - in Edinburgh from 1819 to 1833. The elegy and epitaph are fondly commemorative in tone, virtually saying that somebody had to do this job and that 'Tam' performed his onerous duties well. It appears that the hangman's job became something of a family business, since Tam's son, John, followed in his footsteps. For performing this demanding job, Thomas Williams was given a free house and received a weekly wage of 12 shillings. This wage was known as the 'Doomster's Allowance'.

This sheet is unusual in that it is not a formal prose notice of Hamilton's execution, but rather is a poetic act of public mourning. Very little is known about Hamilton, except that which is stated here: he is a youth who 'accidentally' killed someone and is now to be hung. It is possible that someone who knew him commissioned this piece or that the case was well-publicised at the time. It is also possible that this poem was a standard plate owned by the printers, who simply changed the name and details for each separate order.

It was sourced from the 'Montross Review' of the 7th December, 1821, and includes a woodcut illustration of a woman being hanged.
Margaret Tyndall or Shuttleworth was executed for murdering her husband, Henry Shuttleworth, in the public house they ran together in Montrose. Both were partial to a few drinks, and it is said that an inebriated Margaret was put to bed by a servant on the fateful night of her husband's death. The next morning, with no memory of the night before, Margaret discovered the body of her dead husband. Although the evidence was largely circumstantial, Margaret's fate was ultimately sealed by the discovery of a blood-covered poker in her bedroom. As can be seen by her last speech, Margaret protested her innocence until the end.

There are other broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection which cover this case. This confession seems to be more genuine, heartfelt and human than those of a later date. This sort of report would eventually take on a formulaic style, where only names and dates were really changed. Scotland was also still under the influence of Calvinist and Presbyterian principles.

Perrie was 'Executed at Paisley, October 18th, 1837'. Under the title a small quotation has been provided: '""He died, as erring man should die, / Without display, without parade.""' This broadside was printed by Caldwell and Sons.
Glasgow-born William Perrie was executed for murdering Mary Mitchell, his wife of less than a year, in a fit of jealous rage. His executioner was John Murdoch who, although based in Glasgow, followed the Circuit Courts. Rather than employing their own executioner, it appears that Paisley relied on the services of the Glasgow 'hangman'.

John or Jock Heich, Hiegh, or more properly High, was appointed Edinburgh's hangman in 1778, supposedly in return for dropping the charge of stealing chickens. During his tenure, he oversaw more than 40 hangings and was twice awarded a pay rise. He was buried in Greyfriars churchyard upon his death in 1816.

Whilst Fullarton was found guilty and sentenced to be executed for the robbery and assault of James Hunter, the case against one of his accomplices, a Mr Renton, was not proven. A third man known by the name of Reid, who made his escape after the incident, was later arrested and placed in jail.

Competition was tough amongst the numerous broadside printers in existence, and time was of the essence as each printer strived to be the first with the latest news. This was especially true in crime reporting, where the details of a particular case from the apprehension of the perpetrator to their last words on the gallows were carefully followed.

This broadside covers one aspect of a case which had its focal point in Stirling. The same day as Cain was tried for his part in a theft committed in Stirling, his two colleagues were hung also in Stirling, having been captured and sentenced previously. There are other broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection which detail the whole case.

There are actually two different stories contained on this page, although both cover the same topic - the sensational use and abuse of women.

The emphasis here, is placed on the sympathy of the crowd for a foreigner dying abroad. There is no mention of Ms Budge. The second story concerns the violent theft of articles from a woman in Hampshire by two soldiers.

This Glasgow-published account of Ferguson's hanging in Inverness draws attention to some of the differences between Highland and Lowland Scotland that were more pronounced in the nineteenth century than today.

Although women were protected to a certain extent by rape legislation, there was still a social stigma attached to the victim which often meant that her identity was never revealed. In most cases where the victim was deceased, such as this example, then the name was revealed. This rapist was 'hung in chains' after he was hung, which was a further post-mortem punishment. This was first practised in 1637, but was not legalised until an Act of Parliament was passed in 1752. This barbaric warning was abolished less than a hundred years later in 1834.

The simple fact that this broadside is the tenth one in a long sequence dedicated to the story of the murder at Gilmerton, shows that publishers were well aware that crime broadsides made the most money. Hence the desire to drag out a horrific crime story for as long as possible, until readers expressed a wish for a new sensation. This broadside describes how the two condemned men conducted themselves at their public execution, and uses the men?s final words about what can happen to a person when intoxicated with 'the demon drink' as a chilling warning to others.

The other report begins: 'Execution of Peter Heaman and Francois Gautiez for piracy and murder.' Neither of these two sheet have dates printed attached to them, but the right slip has 'January 9 1822' scrawled across it, whilst the left slip still has the price, one penny, attached.
These two broadsides illustrate all the many features and functions of the archetypal broadside. Broadsides contained today's news or at least news of today's interest and were not supposed to be long-term society records. Here a topical and sensational execution is reported on two different sheets. The information was not exclusive to one printer and so there was healthy competition for sales. This sharing of information was often extended to cribbing each other's or newspaper reports. Finally these reports detail events in sequence and so develop into a full narrative. Whether all on one sheet or made available in instalments, this sequential reporting gave the audience a complete picture.

The name of the publisher is not included.
A career criminal, David Haggart was executed for murdering the jailor at Dumfries Jail during an escape. This broadside is especially interesting because of what it reveals about the stranglehold that Calvinism had on Scottish society at this time. For terrible though the sentence is, the judge emphasises that this is nothing compared to the everlasting punishment he will receive in a higher court - unless he repents now. It appears that Haggart heeded this hellfire warning, as the rest of the broadside focuses on his improved behaviour in 'the condemned cell' and on the scaffold.

This sheet was published by Sanderson of the High Street, Edinburgh, on the 4th April, 1836.
This broadside tells the dreadful story of how Charles Donaldson was executed for beating his wife, Margaret Marr, to death with a frying pan. It emerged during the trial that Donaldson often beat his wife, as he was fed up with her addiction to drink. The catalyst for the murder appears to have been his wife locking him out from the house. As can be seen from the accompanying woodcut illustration, the broadside focuses much attention on the procession to the scaffold, and how Donaldson conducted himself during his last journey.

This sheet was published by Robertson and Thomson of Edinburgh, and cost one penny.
This broadside combines an eye-catching mixture of text and woodcut graphics to describe the execution of The Gilmerton Murderers, David Dobie and John Thomson. The opening woodcut image is of the public scaffold, followed by unflattering sketches of the two murderers that surround a drawing of the victim. This broadside is part of a sequence reporting this particular murder, with the other sheets available for viewing at the National Library of Scotland?s collection.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century.

It was published in Edinburgh for Felix O'Neill.
Because John Hill and William Porter were very young, a petition was started in favour of leniancy, which was even signed by some members of the jury. However, the crime was deemed too serious to allow mercy. The items they stole - shoes, glasses, an old handkerchief and 7 shillings - seem paltry today but the 'Bloody Code', designed to protect property rights and make examples of those not respecting them, was in force. At the time a man could be hung for stealing as little as 5 shillings.

This broadside sold for a penny and was published on the day of Burke's execution, Wednesday, 28th January 1829.
Although Burke and Hare are often referred to as body-snatchers they were not in actual fact grave robbers, as this report proves. They did, however, commit a great many murders, and sell the bodies to Dr Knox at Edinburgh Medical School for dissection in his anatomy classes. Hare escaped trial by giving evidence against Burke, who was hanged on 16 counts of murder. Burke was denied the right to a burial, and his skeleton can still be seen hanging in the Medical School.

The broadside was published by William Henry. The place of publication is not given.
The hanging of William Thomson in Dalkeith was unusual, especially as he had been held in Calton Jail in Edinburgh. Commonly people who committed capital crimes so close to Edinburgh would have been hanged in the city itself, either in the Grassmarket or at the head of Libberton's Wynd. It may be that the nature of Thomson's offence dictated his fate: often highwaymen were hanged at the scene of their crime, and their bodies left there in gibbets as a warning to other potential highwaymen. In this case, however, although Thomson was hanged at the crime scene, his body was taken down and given to his friends for burial.

The second paragraph of this report is identical to another broadside in the National Library of Scotland's collection. In the latter, the text is credited with having been copied from the Edinburgh Star newspaper. This was a common way in which broadsides were assembled quickly and cheaply. Stories could be taken from the larger, more expensive newspapers, and padded out with information that had appeared in earlier broadsides or newspapers. The case itself demonstrates the harshness of Scots law in 1823. The convict, from a poor family, is hanged for housebreaking at only eighteen years of age.

Published in Edinburgh for James Dogherty, this broadside was sold for a penny.
Wilson and Fraser were caught stealing clothes from a tailor's shop in St Mary's Wynd, Edinburgh. Although their crime would not normally have been punishable by death, they were habitual offenders and the judge believed he had no choice but to send them to the scaffold. The tone of the report is overwhelmingly one of pious regret. In common with many crime reports of the day, this broadside is attempting to teach its readers the lesson that Wilson and Fraser did not learn.

This sheet was published in 1824, in Edinburgh, for the booksellers.
Wilson and Fraser were hopeful that the death sentence would be lifted, because their cellmate, who had been condemed to death for highway robbery, was given respite. It was not extended to them, however, even though their crime seems more trivial. Fraser, whose name is also spelt Frazer here, gave the following speech from the scaffold, 'Good People, take warning by our untimely end. Refain from Sabbath-breaking, and the company of bad women, drinking and swearing, which have been ruin. God be with you all.'

This sheet was published in Glasgow, 7th November 1832 by William Carse.
George Duffy, of Irish-Catholic descent as the report highlights, was renowned for beating his wife, Helen Broady, but on this occasion he went further and held her across the fire in the kitchen. After refusing to have her burns tended too she died after nine days, leaving a fourteen-year-old daughter. This report implies that the physical abuse was unfair because Helen was never provocative. It also emphasises Duffy's drink problem and his eventual repentance of it.

It was published by John Muir of Glasgow, and like most of his publications would have probably cost one penny.
The Scottish weavers Andrew Hardie and John Baird were both tried and convicted of high treason and sedition, and sentenced to be executed for their part in the 1820 Rising. Fighting for universal male suffrage, better working conditions and a Scottish parliament, a group of radicals, led by Hardie and Baird, attempted to seize Carron Ironworks, near Falkirk. They were thwarted by the British army, however, who arrested the radicals at Bonnymuir. As this execution notice illustrates, Hardie and Baird died as martyrs to their cause: in Hardie's address to the audience he announced, 'I die a martyr to the cause of truth and injustice'.

Competition was tough amongst the numerous broadside printers in existence, and time was of the essence as each printer strived to be the first with the latest news. This was especially true in crime reporting, where the details of a particular case from the apprehension of the perpetrator to their last words on the gallows were carefully followed. As can be seen here, however, accuracy often suffered: within the first two paragraphs of this report Allan Mair's age is recorded as 80, 84 and 85.

The sheet was printed in Glasgow on the same day as the execution, by William Carse.
This was Greenock's first execution since 1817. A scaffold was erected in front of new church and a huge crowd gathered to witness it. 54-year-old Kerr had been a respected member of the community, with a ship rigging business but a combination of his and his wife's 'intemperance' had led to violence. His 'affecting speech' warns against alcohol abuse. It may have been a fabrication of the publisher's - a device to sell more copies of the story.

James Glen had escaped Glasgow Jail a few months earlier, but had given himself up after finding no-one would harbour him.

John Muir specialised in reports about criminals, their activities and trials. The two men here were convicted of mugging Fillipa Testi of personal effects. It is curious to note that those featured are accompanied by the their country of origin and religion. A list of those executed in Glasgow for the sixty years previous has also been included.

The sheet was published in 1825 by William Carse of Glasgow.
This broadside describes the execution of a young man called James Stevenson, who was sentenced to death for carrying our a highway robbery. After summarising his offence, the broadside's author quickly moves on to report the execution ceremony. Attended by a flock of religious ministers, much of this section is taken up with the concept of achieving redemption through embracing religion. Following the execution scene, the broadside contains a short confession from Stevenson in which he warns others about the many dangers that arise when a person strays from the path of righteousness. The sheet concludes with a short ballad on the subject and a brief biography of Stevenson's life.

The sheet was published by William Carse of Glasgow in 1824.
This broadside tells the horrific tale of a husband who murdered his wife by cutting her throat, and whose body was discovered by her two children. The report starts off by describing the good character of the deceased woman, and also mentions that no property was taken from the house. In turn, this shifts suspicion on to the husband, a former weaver from Donegal in Ireland, who denied the crime. Pronouncing him guilty, the sentencing judge strongly advises him to make his peace with God before entering into the next world.

The sheet was published by William Carse of Glasgow, who is listed as working from various addresses in Glasgow between 1820 and 1836.
This broadside tells of a man named John McCreevie, who was executed for housebreaking and theft in the village of Springvale, which is now part of the Glasgow conurbation. Although, from a modern viewpoint, the sentence appears to be harsh one, the 'Criminal Code' (called the 'Bloody Code' in England) that existed from 1650 to 1840 was primarily designed to protect property. On many occasions, however, the death sentence was commuted to one of transportation for less serious crimes. Revealingly and unusually, the final paragraph contains an emotional passage regarding why there is so much crime, and controversially concludes that unemployment and poverty is to blame.

A note at the bottom of the sheet states that it was 'printed for the Booksellers' in Ayr.
Set against the gothic background of a storm, this broadside describes the execution of two men, James Anderson and David Glen, who were convicted of murder. After reminding the audience of the men's crimes, the writer concentrates attention on their demeanour and spiritual state of health in the condemned cell. The next setting is the scaffold, where the men make a joint confession in the form of a lengthy prayer, with a great emphasis being placed on earning forgiveness from God.

This broadside tells of the violent end that befell Francis Cain and George Laidlaw, who were executed for carrying out a highway robbery and breaking into a jeweller's shop. The tone of this sheet is confessional, with a strong emphasis on redemption through embracing religion. It is also interesting to note the young ages of the two condemned men - a point highlighted by the writer of the sheet.

This broadside describes the executions of a robber and a highwayman. In the first case, two men were actually convicted of the crime, although only one of the two, George Laidlaw, received the death sentence. Laidlaw was sentenced to death because he was considered to be the instigator and planner of the crime. With its descriptions of tollbooths and coach journeys, the second case tells us much about how people travelled at this time. In this case, it seems that only the ringleader, Francis Cain, was sentenced to death, with his accomplices being sentenced either to transportation or a stay of execution pending a recommendation to mercy.

It is not clear from this broadside what the circumstances surrounding McNicol's sentence were, although it does sound like Graham was killed whilst McNicol was attempting to escape from jail. The text is primarily concerned with McNicol's interaction with the ministers and the state of his soul before he met his Maker. Scotland was still under the influence of Calvinist and Presbyterian doctrines, and their impact upon society can be seen in documents like this. It is curious, that it was noted, that most of the conversation occurred in 'the Highland Tongue', showing an awareness of Scotland's linguistic divide at the time.

On the evening of the 3d of August last, with his Speech upon the scaffold, also a copy of his Lamentation.'
Broadsides were often used as a forum for moral instruction, and since this murder resulted from Tennant's drink habit, the broadside does go on to exhort the evils of alcohol. It does, however, include a lamentation, supposedly Tennant's last words, which is a common feature on broadsides. It was an opportunity to tug at the audience's heart and ask them to look at their own behaviour. There are other reports of this case held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

It was not unusual for huge crowds to gather at a hanging but certain cases attracted more attention than others. This case was extremely popular as the details of it proved to be quite salacious and lurid. After being abandoned by her family and lover but being left with an illegitimate son, Mary MacKinnon opened a public house and brothel. This appeal to the public's morbid curiosity is taken further in this text by the descriptions of her mind, apparel and physicalities.

Howat, a clerk by trade, initiated a drunken brawl which MacKinnon ended with a domestic knife.

McIntryre and Paterson were convicted of robbing a fairly large quantity of clothing from the house of John Niven, tanner, in Greenock. Both were habitual thieves and McIntryre especially was hardened to life, saying he 'didn't care a damn' on hearing the sentence. Paterson burst into tears when he was told his life was forfeit. Dyer's case was unconnected but he was also charged with theft by housebreaking. Their executioner was Thomas Young.
The many crime reports that form part of the National Library of Scotland's broadside collection offer a fascinating insight into crime and punishment in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Scotland. Whilst the penalty of death might appear unusually harsh for these men, execution was in fact a common punishment for housebreaking and theft at this time, and was intended very much as a deterrent to others.","Broadside regarding the execution of Michael MacIntyre, William Paterson and Wardrope Dyer",1821

It was published by John Muir of Glasgow and probably sold for one penny.
Crime reports were by far and away the most popular amongst the broadside readership; the more gruesome the crime, the more copies sold! In many cases a particular crime could generate a sequence of sheets covering everything from the discovery of a body and the apprehension of the criminal to the trial and, in most cases, the execution of the culprit. This particular execution notice ends with the suggestion that Margaret Wishart caused much disturbance after her death by haunting her old house in Orchard Road, Arbroath.

This sheet was printed in 1718, by a publisher who had premises 'at the Foot of the Horse Wynd', Edinburgh.
It is interesting to note many oblique features of eighteenth century society in this text. The Church had begun to be involved in some aspects of rudimentary education for younger children, especially in non-urban areas. Here Margaret's lack of education, poverty and her pregnancy out with marriage are linked as ideas. Furthermore, the Calvinist and Presbyterian religious principles, so prevalent in Scotland, are highlighted as the Minister publicly questions Margaret about her pregnancy and involves 'parishioners' in discovering her secret. Finally, Margaret was caught because there was a fire at her house because she left the hearth untended - a continual domestic hazard.

It was published by John Muir of Glasgow.
Today John Thomas would probably be recognised as a serial killer, a term that had not been coined in 1822. His crimes appear to have been motivated principally by a desire to harm and kill, and the report notes that on his arrest, Thomas admitted to 'several other shocking murders'. His dying speech, which attributes his criminality to alcohol, loose women and sabbath-breaking, follows conventions of the period and reveals little about Thomas. It was probably written by one of the ministers who attended Thomas after his conviction.

Stewart and Wright's case caused a sensation in Scotland when they confessed to ten more murders after their trial. Their method was to poison their victims with laudanum, then rob them. With the trial of Burke and Hare coming less than a year previously, citizens of Glasgow and Edinburgh were deeply concerned about public safety and law and order, and some of the many broadsides covering Stewart and Wright's case expressed these concerns.

It was printed by McLachlan of Dumfires, and was probably priced at one penny.
Although William Richardson, Joseph's brother, was also convicted for the same crime and condemned to die, the Magistrates received a letter from Robert Peel, Secretary of State for the Home Department, stating that his Majesty had granted William a reprieve. Joseph Richardson and John McKana (also spelt M'Canna and McKena) were offered no such reprieve, however, and were executed in front of the prison at Buccleuch Street, Dumfries. McCanna was a 39 year old Irish emigrant. He married a Lockerbie woman and worked as a roadman.

A third man by the name of Robert Stewart, also involved in the robbery, was 'outlawed' for not appearing in court. John Craig and James Brown, meanwhile, were both executed outside the County Buildings in Paisley.

In the first paragraph of this broadside reference is made to the execution of Gow and Beveridge. James Gow and Robert Beveridge were both executed on the 2nd December 1831 for murdering their respective wives. Another broadside in the National Library of Scotland's collection offers Gow's dying speech. The broadside seen here is decorated by a woodcut showing a hanged man. Woodcuts were printed from a design cut in relief along the length of the grain. They were often rather crudely made and generally lacked much detail. Printers were renowned for reusing the limited selection of woodcuts in their possession. Whilst in this instance the woodcut is appropriate, in many cases the illustration selected bore no relevance to the topic of the broadside.

Campbell, a thief, would not accept his fate peacefully and in the weeks before the execution his upsetting wails from the cells could be heard by passers by. So desperate was he to live that he grabbed the noose as the floor went from under him.

John McGraddy was executed for breaking into the house of the Reverend Mr McCall of Muiravonside and stealing a number of items. This included a sum of money which, to make the crime all the more shocking, had been collected for the deaf and dumb institution of Edinburgh. An accomplice is mentioned, but his identity is not disclosed. As illustrated here, emphasis was often placed on a criminal's remorse over his or her misconduct and the valuable moral lesson it afforded the reader. Despite this, most people simply appreciated the reports for their entertainment value and their shock factor.

There are many broadsides contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection recounting the execution of women for child-murder - indeed it is the crime predominantly committed by women sentenced to execution. The heinousness of the action lay in the taking of an innocent life rather than the murder itself. There are, however, very few cases where the woman's right-hand is focused on: this is quite an usual occurrence. Perhaps it is the hand with which Shank committed the crime.

It was published by John Muir of Glasgow on 4th June 1823.
Often reports of executions included a transcipt of the condemned man's last words. In this instance, a transcript of an 'Address to the Spectators at the Execution' is included instead. The speaker who gave the address is not named, but it is likely that it was one of the magistrates or ministers who attended the execution.

James Campbell had already been sentenced to death for housebreaking, at Glasgow in 1822 but had his sentence was commuted, to transportation for life.

There is a woodcut illustration of gallows and body included above the title. This illustration is quite common on execution notices.
This case must have caused a stir at the time as there are other sheets held in the National Library of Scotland's collection covering the progression of the case. Both the trial details and a more personal account of the crime and Bryce's state of mind were also published.

This broadside tells of the tragic fate that befell James Brown and John Craig, who were executed at Paisley Jail in 1829 for housebreaking and theft. The writer emphasises that it is rare for Paisley to witness a public execution, and he proceeds to describe some of the previous executions that took place in the town.

This broadside tells of the tragic end that befell Dennis Doolan and Patrick Redding, who were executed in Bishopbriggs, Glasgow, on the 23rd of April 1841. The two railway workers were found guilty of murdering their supervisor, John Green, during the building of the Glasgow to Edinburgh railway. A third man, James Hickie, was also found guilty, but was later reprieved. It seems that the authorities were worried that there would be trouble at this execution, and several regiments of soldiers were appointed to control the crowd of 50,000. The execution went ahead without any trouble, however, and the pair were executed by John Murdoch, who received £24 for performing this work - which is about £1,170 in today's terms.

It was relatively unusual for stories from other parts of the country to be published in Scotland. However, if it was a particularly shocking, interesting, or unusual story, it would sometimes be picked up by Scots publishers eager to boost sales. This sad story of a mill worker who tried to conceal her pregnancy and then, in what seemed to be a state of panic, killed her newborn child is one such example.

Broadsides were produced quickly and cheaply so that the information contained in them would be relevant to the moment and cheap to buy. This sheet, however, is badly set. It cuts off mid-sentence and mid-paragraph at the bottom of the page and begins mid-sentence also. The information reported in it is equally hit and miss. The victim is reported as Margaret Mooney although she is called Elizabeth in other reports. It is also claimed that Mooney and McEwen had only known each other a week when they had been together for over a year.

As no motive or defence is offered by the prisoner for her evil deed, the tone here is very much one of demonising the woman. In short, her behaviour appears to be inexplicable.

Although this report claims to contain a 'particular account' of the execution of Charles McEwen, the scene at the scaffold is barely mentioned, unlike some other broadside reports of executions which describe the hanging in great detail. Instead, this broadside is concerned mainly with the life of the condemned man, and the circumstances of his crime. What stands out about Charles McEwen is his restlessness. He apparently had children by several women, and travelled widely around the north of Scotland. He also used several names, suggesting he had committed previous crimes. It is noted in the broadside that even while manacled and awaiting execution, McEwen could not contain his restless spirit.

The term 're-printed' is mentioned in the details along the bottom. Often stories were copied from printer to printer, both to save time and money, or plates were reused if the case was ongoing to make the most of the typesetting. This one was 'folded' at the printing house opposite the Tron Church. Different parts of the process were carried out by different trades and often the distributor was separate again.

This broadside begins with a potted history of executions in Paisley, mainly those of Alexander Provan and Thomas Potts, before touching on the case of John Craig and James Brown. Both men were executed on the 29th October, 1829, at County Square, Paisley, for the crime of stouthrief, which in Scots law means robbery with violence. It is said that both men were highly repentant and begged Robertson's forgiveness. Compared with many other execution reports, which go on at great length and contain every grisly detail, this is an unusually short and straightforward account.

This broadside appears to have been hastily assembled, indeed it was published almost immediately after the events it recounts. The National Library of Scotland holds several reports relating to this case and this one has almost exactly copied the wording of previous accounts, but also includes some fresh text giving the most up to the minute information about the proceedings of McEwan's execution.

Published by Wallam (William) Reid, of Edinburgh, in 1835.
Jock Heigh's real name was John High, and he was appointed in 1778. A good servant of the city, he hanged over 40 culprits, and, unlike those who came after him, was very careful never to cause any unnecessary suffering to those he hanged. He was buried in Greyfriar's Churchyard upon his death in 1816.
The real point of this broadside is to lambast the incompetent hangman, John Williams, who was in post for only four months in 1835. The execution of Private James Bell was a fiasco and Williams was lucky to escape the near-rioting crowd. He was stoned as he escaped down Libberton's Wynd and resigned from his post the next day.",Broadside entitled 'Last Words and Dying Declaration of Jock Heigh the Hangman',1835

It was published on 1st November 1826 by William Carse of Glasgow.
Stewart's victim, Filippo Testti, is called a 'foreigner' in the report, as well as being identified as a looking-glass manufacturer. Testti was probably an Italian immigrant to Scotland. From the start of the industrial revolution in the late eighteenth century, migration to Scotland increased dramatically, but until almost the end of the nineteenth century any Italian immigrants tended to be specialist craftsmen, like Testti. Although no racist motive is imputed to Stewart in this broadside, the new waves of incomers to Scotland certainly encountered suspicion and hostility in some quarters.

The publisher was John Muir of Glasgow.
This is one of two broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection that describe Stewart and Kelly's execution, and small discrepancies between the two reveal how the author of this broadside tried to make it appeal to the public. Whereas the other report suggests that the crowd for the execution was smaller than usual, this account describes the 'great multitude' present. Likewise, the 'some others' who were Stewart's accomplices become, in this report, 'villains so numerous that they frightened away every person'. The highly excitable tone of the broadside is signalled at the very start, when Stewart and Kelly's offence is described as the 'daring crime' of street robbery.

High treason was considered at this time to be the most serious of captial crimes. Any activities that were deemed a betrayal of one's country and were thought to pose a serious threat to the monarchy were considered treasonous and, as such, carried a severe penalty. Men found guilty of high treason were hung, drawn and quartered. This involved the man being dragged or drawn to the gallows, hanged and cut down whilst still alive, his stomach cut open and entrails removed and burned, his head cut off and body divided into four parts. The head and four parts were often put on public display to act as a deterrent. For the same crime, women were burnt at the stake.

As the text goes on to reveal, the author of this piece, Alexander Pennecuik (d. 1730), was the nephew of Dr Alexander Pennecuik (1652-1722). Both men were well known for their humorous and topical verse, and several examples of their work can be found in the National Library of Scotland's broadside collection. Here, Pennecuik has wryly written a last speech for the eighteenth-century Edinburgh hangman, John Dalgleish. For someone who witnessed the last speeches of those he executed, it was a novel idea to imagine one of his own creation.

During much of the eighteenth century, Tyburn tree was the main place of public execution for the London area. The condemned prisoners were held in Newgate prison before making the journey to the gallows. This broadside gives a brief summary of the Mary Baker case and a final speech by the condemned prisoner in which she lists all of her husbands, mostly by name. Whether these words were in fact her own is not known for sure. Last speeches were often written to a formula, which included repentence and religious enlightenment.

This broadside was intended to act as a severe warning to anyone who rejected God. By instilling fear in the readership, it was hoped that people would follow the 'righteous path'. Sentenced to be executed for committing infanticide, Margaret Dickson is portrayed as an evil and sinful woman who followed the ways of the devil: 'For when the heart's not bolted aginst Sin, / It [l]et's the Devil and Damnation in.' Although she was hanged in the Grassmarket, she dramatically revived en route to Musselburgh for burial. She was set free and lived to a ripe old age having many children.

On 18th April, 1823, Kinrade and Camaish were sentenced to execution on the Isle of Man for poisoning Kinrade's sister, Mrs. Camaish, whilst she was pregnant, so that John and Catherine could be together. An account of this case also appeared in the local newspaper the 'Manx Sun' on 22 April 1823. Both of the executed pair were apparently from Lezayre parish in the north of the island. Although this incident happened in the Isle of Man, the moral lesson and horror of the story travelled effortlessly to Glasgow. It illustrates how avid audiences were for news and entertainment.

After a prose introduction, there follows a poem about the condemned man in his cell. Following this there is a favourable character analysis of Mr Salt.
The author is sympathetic to Salt's predicament throughout and ends by mentioning that a petition had been organise, to try to have Salt's sentence commuted. One 'lady of Edinburgh' is even criticised for not signing it.",Broadside entitled 'A Voice from the Dungeon',1838-1842

Many different crimes are detailed on this sheet, from a Jesuit, executed in 1615 for being more loyal to the Pope than the King, to two adulterers who were banished from Scotland in 1762. It shocks and also deters the reader, for fear of what could happen to them. For example, it reports that the law regarding adultery is still in force. This may have worried a few people!

The National Library of Scotland also holds a broadside printed at the end of Dalgleish's tenure, entitled, 'The last speech and dying words of John Dalgleish, lock man alias hang-man of Edinburgh'.

Broadsides were often used as vehicles for political expression, due to the large and varied audience which they could reach. Here Colonel Oxburgh was executed for being a Catholic Jacobite, who supported those who fought at the battle of Preston. Oxburgh, in his speech, highlights the further political tensions caused by changing the line of succession and claims that Catholic or not, it was his duty to support James VII, as the true and rightful king.

The first takes the form of a letter from the condemned prisoner's mother, Lady Boghall, and the second from a man, Alexander Pennecuik, suspected of being an accessory to the murder. Both are addressed to Nicol Mucshet (who is referred to in other broadsides as Muschet or Mushet). It is worth noting that in each, a different spelling of the prisoner's name is used - Mushet, Mushett and Mucshet.

As well as the above account of Margaret Henderson's case, this broadside contains cautionary verses allegedly written by the condemned girl, and a letter to her mother written on the eve of her execution.

This alludes to the deepening and widening of the Clyde, an operation which would ultimately be the making of Glasgow as an international centre of trade, shipbuilding and engineering.

An account of the trial and sentence of William Adams can also be found in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

John Dalgleish, or Daglees, replaced Sutherland as Edinburgh hangman in 1722. Dalgleish was a famous figure around the capital, and his name is used to ominous effect in other broadsides, for example, 'Panegyrick on Robert Cowan's Trip to the Tron'. The author of this piece is believed to be Alexander Pennecuik, who died in 1730, making it likely that it was published in the late 1720s.

This sheet was published by R. Watson of Edinburgh and cost one penny.
This broadside tells of the trial, confession and execution of Samuel Maxwell or McCormack, for burglary. Maxwell's virtuous confession gives substance to the saying that there is 'honour among thieves', since he tells the court that the other three accused men had nothing to do with the crime, and that he alone was responsible. Although the sentence of death for the relatively minor crime of housebreaking might seem extreme, it should be remembered that the aim of the 'Bloody Code' (called the 'Criminal Code' in Scotland) was to protect property above all else - hence the execution.

After an evening out on the town, Robert Dempsey and his fellow soldiers ended up fighting a group of sailors and some members of the public. One thing led to another, and the angry mob pursued Dempsey and his friends to their lodgings. The soldiers ran upstairs and fired at the mob, killing three of them. Only Dempsey was sentenced to death for these murders, his comrade, Robert Surrage, was banished for life. After summarising the story, the broadsheet reports Dempsey?s last words before he was 'launched into eternity'.

The judicial system at this time placed more gravity on property crime than anything else. As a result these two thieves were not viewed lightly by the law. This certainly is made clear in the report as the 'aggravated' nature of their offences is stressed. In this case the two men had completed three robberies in a row and there were witnesses to clear any ambiguities. They were then hanged in Libberton Wynd, which was the place where most executions took place.

This is one of a number of broadsides held by the National Library of Scotland covering this sensational case. Often, the number of broadsides produced reveals the importance of the case. It is important, however, to also remember that the extant quantities may not be a true representation of the original numbers. Many of these broadsides have survived because they were actively collected by enthusiastic people. As a result, the collections reflect that person's interests and means.

The National Library of Scotland's collection also contains a broadside detailing the trial and sentencing of William McIntyre. Both were printed by John Muir of Glasgow and largely contain the same information on the trial, including the Lord Justice Clerk's reaction to the verdict. This broadside, however, also gives a very brief account of McIntyre's execution at Liberton's Wynd. McIntyre's short address to the audience follows a typical style favoured by broadside producers. Whilst it is possible he uttered these words, it is also possible that they were 'placed in his mouth' by the broadside printer - religious and moral instruction from the condemned sold sheets.

It was published by John Muir of Glasgow and is dated 16th May 1821.
The sentence of death for forgery appears very harsh, but the judge's decision was probably swayed by Swan's earlier trial for a similar crime where, despite being acquitted, he was warned that the suspicion against him would not be forgotten. The report records that Swan's appeal to the Secretary of State failed because a recent forgery case in Stirling had also resulted in the death penalty. This is a reference to the case of John Fleming, who was executed at Stirling five days before Swan for issuing a forged £5 note.

It was printed by Thomas Duncan of 159 The Saltmarket, Glasgow.
The Saltmarket area of Glasgow was renowned throughout the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries for the quantity of street literature which was produced here. Duncan, in business by himself between 1800 and 1823, was one of three big, rival firms operating from the street during this period. Along with William Carse and John Muir, Duncan competed for Circuit Court lists and execution notices. Duncan was relatively successful during his stint in the Saltmarket, although he twice had to move premises due them collapsing under the weight of the equipment!

Connor or Conner and McMenemy were both in their early 20s and hailed from County Tyrone, Ireland. From this report it appears that Connor's mother was much to blame for encouraging her son's lawlessness, which is catalogued in the report. McMenemy had never been in trouble until she met the Connor family, but she was soon 'hurried on from one crime to another with a rapidity that gave her no time for reflection'.

Thomas Connor or Conner, and Isabella, 'Bell', McMenemy were systematic robbers who were sentenced to be hung after they were caught for attacking and robbing boatman Alex McKinnon. Two others were involved in the crimes but were acquitted. Bell would entice men into a quiet place and then the rest of the gang would pounce.

This sheet was published by Forbes and Owen of Edinburgh.
With rather frightening sketches of the two condemned men underneath the broadside?s headline, this sheet dramatically tells of the execution of murderers, David Dobie and John Thomson. The anonymous writer first gives details of the crime, before describing the behaviour of the men in 'the condemned cell'. The emphasis in this section is very much on atonement and redemption through religion. The 'Second Edition' part of the sheet describes the execution and focuses on how the men conducted themselves on the scaffold.

The publishers of broadsides were aware that a particularly 'big' or sensational story would retain the public interest over several days or weeks and sometimes several broadsides would be produced covering one case. We can infer from the paragraph beginning 'Beveridge, who our readers will recollect...' that this broadside is not the first to have been produced by this particular publisher on the subject of these murders. The public enthusiasm for murder cases and executions is also made apparent by the reference within the broadside report to the 'great concourse of people assembled' for the hangings. It was customary for broadsheet authors to comment on the size of the crowd at an execution.

It was published on 12th December 1827 by John Muir of Glasgow.
Several broadsides were produced covering Glen's case, which suggests the high level of public outrage and interest it provoked. The broadside author notes that this is the third recorded case of a father being executed for infanticide in Glasgow. Infanticide was a crime traditionally more associated with women, because of the social stigma of having an illegitimate child, but here the author explains that the church's abolition of compulsory public repentance for single mothers had reduced the number of women killing their children.

This broadside is a rather dark inventory, naming all the individuals who have been executed in Glasgow between 1765 and 1820, plus a list of their crimes. Who might have been interested in buying such a sheet, one can only imagine. For the modern audience, however, this sheet tells us much about the philosophy of the legal system and the rule of law during this era. In particular, it illustrates that the protection of property was the main concern of the authorities, as evidenced by the large number of people who were executed for crimes such as housebreaking, theft, robbery and forgery.

It was published by William Carse of Edinburgh, and probably would have cost one penny.
William Carse was one of three Glasgow printers, the others being John Muir and Thomas Duncan, who specialised in printing such material. They also produced the daily list of the Circuit Court with the names of those to be tried and sentenced on any given day. This composite list was partly intended to act as a warning to anyone tempted by crime. The phrase, 'Of all who deviate from the paths of rectitude', suggests that such a grisly end is inevitable for all those who commit an offence.

Whilst James Gow headlines this broadside, the simultaneous execution of Robert Beveridge for a similar crime is also briefly cited. The main body of the broadside, however, contains Gow's repentful last words, said in the form of a prayer. The reader is also treated to Gow's final utterances 'on this earth', 'Lord have mercy on our souls; Lord, receive our souls'. Whether these were in fact Gow's last words is another matter. Last speeches were often reused by printers, with only the appropriate details, such as name and nature of crime, changed.

For example, in this printed version lines 39-41 read: 'At the / who counselled, instructed, and by every tie which links human / nature together, warned him of impending danger.' Clearly there are words missing beween lines 39 and 40 as they are printed here, and there are similar omissions elsewhere in the broadside.

This story was sourced from the 'Caledonian Mercury' of Monday Oct. 11, 1830, and the broadside was published by John Muir.
This broadside narrates the tragic story of Catherine Davidson, executed for giving her husband vitriol (sulphuric acid) to drink. It recounts how Mrs. Davidson conducted herself in the condemned cell, and also records her last words of 'Oh, my God'. The broadsheet then concludes by informing its readers that this was the first public execution of a woman in Aberdeen for 45 years. The fact that the previous woman was executed (in 1784) for stealing linen cloth and women?s clothes, illustrates just how harsh and repressive the 'Criminal Code' (known as the 'Bloody Code' in England) was in Scotland, from about 1660 to 1850.

This rather grim report does not dwell on many of the most compelling aspects of the crime, but rather simply sets the scene and conveys the facts. The child's name, age or sex is never mentioned, perhaps reflecting nineteenth century attitudes towards children. It is unusual to find an incident of a man committing infanticide, although there are many reports held in the National Library of Scotland's collection, covering women and their stories.

This sheet was published by Robertson and Co.
With a chilling, Bruegel-like illustration of a gallows underneath the Murder headline, this broadside tells the woeful story of Margaret Davidson, who was executed for poisoning her husband while he slept. After demonising the woman for her evil crime, there is a change in tone as Davidson's confession appears in the narrative. Forgiveness from God, redemption and a warning to others are the main themes in such confessions from the prisoner in 'the condemned cell'. The broadside concludes with the execution and the body being whisked away to a medical school for dissection.

No publisher is named for this broadside, though the story has been sourced from the 'Courant' newspaper.
The Gilmerton Murder was a notoriously heinous crime, and a large number of broadsides by various printers were published on this chilling subject. This broadside is especially interesting in that it offers the reader a quick overview of the murderers? early lives, before describing the crime and concluding with their execution.

He worked in Scotland between the years 1852 and 1870. A brief biography of Calcraft is given at the beginning of this account.

Whilst many aspects of this document are historically noteworthy, two are worth mentioning. This sheet was published by a woman - Margaret Reid. She succeeded to her father's tools and trade upon his death and was a prolific chapbook producer. Also, the murder of a husband by his wife was considered 'petty treason' and women were burnt instead of hung for this to preserve their modesty. They were, however, normally strangled before the flames reached them.
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers. Crimes could generate sequences of sheets covering descriptive accounts, court proceedings, last words, lamentations and executions as they occurred. As competition was fierce, immediacy was paramount, and these occasions provided an opportunity for printers and patterers to maximise sales.",Broadside concerning the burning of Anne Fogget,1716

Together with an account of his wonderful Dream, and the strange Conversation he had with the Mermaid, and how he was preserved after his Return to Inverness.' There are no publication details included on this sheet.
Illustrated with two woodcuts depicting nautical images, this broadside tells the story of a young seafarer who entered a fantastical land, after being caught up in a storm at sea. It seems that he met a beautiful young lady who showed him round her castle, which was guarded by five massive serpents. It turns out, however, that this young lady was in fact a mermaid. The delirious nature of the sailor means that his story is blurred between a dream landscape and real life, although he claims that the ring on his finger was a token of affection left to him by the mermaid. Supernatural tales such as this would have appealed to the imagination of the general public.

There are no publication details on the sheet.
John Thomson's real name was Helen Oliver, and she had apparently begun her transformation into a man whilst serving as a maid in East Kilbride. Apparently a 'particular intimacy took place between her and a person in a neighbouring house, who officiated as a ploughman'. It turned out that this 'ploughman' was also female and introduced her to the idea of changing sex, at least outwardly.
The report goes on to explain that John Thomson had been known by other names, and had been 'discovered' in Glasgow a few months previous. Her true sex was revealed when she fell from a ladder and a workmate was brushing lime from her chest. It is interesting to note that the tone of the piece is not condemnatory although 'John' is expected to move on to Haddington and work under another name.","Broadside report regarding a woman who masqueraded as a man, c. 1820",1820

Included at the top of the sheet are woodcut illustrations of three sailing vessels.
Woodcut illustrations generally added to a broadside's appeal and proved popular amongst the readership. In this instance, the image included relates to the subject of the broadside. In many cases, however, the illustration bore little or no relation to the topic at hand. For efficiency and cost-effectiveness, many broadside producers chose to reuse their, often limited, stock of woodcut images.

This ballad is structured as an exchange of recriminations between a husband and wife while both are suffering from hangovers earned at their local agricultural fair. The local fair is a significant symbol of community in Scottish literature, and fairs are often portrayed as bawdy, drunken, knockabout occasions where prevailing notions of morality and respectability are forgotten. Allan Ramsay (1684-1758), Robert Fergusson (1750-74) and Robert Burns (1759-96) all wrote fine poems about such occasions, some based on the great Scots ballad 'Christ's Kirk on the Green' which was attributed to King James V (b. 1512-1548) and frequently reprinted on broadsides.

The woodcut above the title displays a well-dressed couple sitting in a parlour playing cards. Despite the rough nature of the illustration, the lady looks out of the scene to catch the reader's eye and engage them. This is a classic artist's trick.
This is the story of a couple who spent all their money and pawned most of their goods so that they could enjoy the Paisley fair to its full extent. Now the event is over, they are left quarrel about their decisions and behaviour but promise to start economising, but only until New Year! Both partners seem to have had romantic affairs during this period also, but they remain unconcerned about this as a couple.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

The name 'TOBERMORY' is printed at the foot of the poem, but it is unclear whether this is the name of the author, or of the publisher, or of the place of publication. Beneath this, a pencil annotation has been added: '(A.M. Bisset, Bathgate)'. Again the significance of the name and place is not explained.
For centuries, the agricultural fair has been an important and symbolic event in Scottish society and in Scottish writing. Many poems and novels record the annual fair as an event where people from a country and town would mingle, where alcohol would flow freely, where people from a traditionally austere background could lose their inhibitions, and where romance or aggression could take root with equal ease. In this poem, the fair takes on a magical aura for the narrator as he remembers the romance with 'Jessie' that began there.

This broadside ballad tells of a young woman from the Highlands who visits Glasgow to attend a fair. The writer proceeds, in a light-hearted manner, to tell his audience about the various shows and acts that she views while walking round the fair. Unfortunately, however, one of the male performers relieves the apparently innocent and naïve country girl of her purse, only to suddenly find himself at the wrong end of a Highland dirk. After a brief tussle, the police arrive and throw the young woman into prison. Following the court case and subsequent fine, the writer concludes that this is probably the last time the woman will attend the Glasgow Fair.

The dialogue structure, as exemplified here, was quite common in Scots poetry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, partly due to its popularity with the great eighteenth-century poets Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns. The dialogue form was derived from classical models, particularly the work of Plato. Whereas in the classics the form was the basis of a serious philosophical debate, in Scotland it was often used ironically, to satirise the opinions and pretensions of two comic characters. In this example 'Cuddy Willie' and 'Hawkie' start by discussing world affairs but end up in prison after a drunken brawl. The 'Hawkie' referred to is possibly the well-known Glasgow street character of the mid-19th century. Born William Cameron, near Stirling in 1790, he became famous in Glasgow as a writer and seller of 'last words' and chapbooks. He also plied his trade in Paisley and Edinburgh.

This ballad was published at the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee by William Shepherd.
'Forfar Fair' is narrated by Tam, an apprentice tailor, who goes to the fair and gets drunk and amorous with a local girl, Maggy Jack. The ballad ends with Tam in a dilemma: Tam has fallen in love with Maggy, while the master tailor expects Tam to marry his daughter. The community fair, usually climaxing in drunkenness, violence or both, is a conventional setting in Scottish ballad poetry. It was used by the likes of Allan Ramsay and Robert Burns and originated with the great Scots poems 'Peblis [Peebles] to the Play' (anon. c.1430-1450) and 'Christ's Kirk on the Green', which has been attributed to James V of Scotland (b. 1512-1542).
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s.

Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills.

The first ballad is set in Glasgow and is a light-heart narrative, about finding love and a life-long partner on a holiday. The second song is much more serious and has a pro-Irish-Catholic political message.

Broadsides were the cheap and ready entertainment of their day and as such could be purchased on the streets.

The feeing time was traditionally when farmhands and servants were employed. It happened twice a year, at the end of May and the end of November. If a person missed the feeing time, it could mean a long and difficult search for work. In this song, however, the two characters find love as a result.

'Country Hirings' was obviously a popular song. The National Library of Scotland holds at least two broadside versions of it. Ballads had long been sung among the peasant and working classes in Scotland, and political protest was a recurring thread in the genre. This song is highly critical of the increasing superior and exploitative attitude of farmers to their hired labourers. The rural labour pool became relatively greater in the nineteenth century as specialisation and mechanisation of farming meant that less workers were needed on many farms, leaving farmers with greater power.

'Country Hirings' is highly critical of the changing attitudes it perceives farmers to have towards their hired staff. Traditional mixed farms were very dependent on labourers, who were taken on for six months at a time. It was common practice for the labourers, who often lived communally in bothies, to take meals with the farmer's family. In the nineteenth century, specialised farming, where farmers cultivated only one type of livestock, or one or two crops, meant that labourers were less in demand, and mechanised machinery increased this trend. As farmers could earn more and pay out less, the gulf in social status widened.

'Christ's Kirk on the Green' is one of the most popular and influential poems ever to have been produced in Scotland. Its description of a rural fair degenerating into a mass brawl struck a popular chord, and inspired works such as 'Leith Races' by Robert Fergusson and 'The Holy Fair' by Robert Burns. The distinctive 'Christ's Kirk' verse form and boisterous subject matter were derived from an anonymous fifteenth century Scots poem, 'Peblis [Peebles] to the Play', which is acknowledged in the opening verse of 'Christ's Kirk on the Green'.

This writer of this ballad considers the attraction of leaving Scotland to start a new life elsewhere, before deciding that Scotland, with its glorious past, is not an easy country to part company from. Indeed, the writer points out that even though Scotland is a cold and wet place with sterile soil, he still loves the country and will not join those who are emigrating from Scotland. In short, this ballad is all about the joys of living in Scotland, at a time when thousands of Scots were emigrating from the land of their birth.

This song is narrated by a man who goes off to sea, leaving his sweetheat behind, and returns to discover that she has married someone else. Themes of parting, and of betrayal, are not uncommon in broadside ballads, but whereas in many cases these are sad songs, this example is intended to be quite humorous. The song subverts traditional romantic imagery: the presents the narrator buys for his lover are not jewels and spices but tortoises and a rat and a cockatoo, and the lover herself is not a young maiden but a twice-married laundrywoman aged forty. The reference to 'Milford Bay' suggests this may be a Canadian song.

Broadside ballads on the subject of love lost were quite common. This example is narrated by 'Barney', whose sweetheart Norah Magee has left him and their native Ireland to travel the world. The song is a plea to Norah to return. Quite a number of the broadside ballads in the National Library of Scotland's collection are set in Ireland or about Ireland. This probably reflects the high levels of Irish migration to Scotland that took place during industrialisation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

16414,emigration,RB.m.143(119),"The first ballad begins: 'Far frae my ain hame I wander, / But still my thoughts return'. The second ballad begins: 'They're far ower the sea, the freen's we lo'e sae weel, / They're far, far across the stormy main'. The third ballad begins: 'Says I, bonnie lassie, will ye gang wi' me, / An' leave your friends in their ain country?' The fourth ballad begins: 'Our bravest on the turf lie dead / On dark Flodden Field'.
The first two songs deal with a subject that would have been familiar to a large number of Scots, that of emigration to distant shores. 'My Ain Folk' is from the perspective of those who have left their beloved homeland, whilst 'They're Far Far Awa'' is from the viewpoint of the people who were left behind. With the Scottish diaspora of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, such themes were extremely popular and struck a chord with many people.
Whilst the narrator of the 'Gallowa' Hills' is not seeking to travel overseas, he is trying to entice his sweetheart to leave her friends and family behind and follow him into the hills. Although slightly different to the first two ballads, it deals with similar themes: the desire to seek out a new and better life coupled with the pain felt by leaving one's home. The final ballad, 'Dark Flodden Field', deals with the aftermath of the Battle of Flodden (1513), where the English defeated the Scots under King James IV, who along with over 10,000 Scots died on the battlefield. Rousing patriotic sentiments, the song ends on a positive note: 'Yet Scotland shall outlive thy stain, / Dark Flodden Field'.","Broadside ballads entitled 'My Ain Folk', 'They're Far Far Awa'', 'Gallowa' Hills', and 'Dark Flodden Field'",1880-1900

This song was published on another broadside by James Lindsay but with the address 9 King Street, Glasgow, which were his premises previous to 11 King Street, between 1852 and 1859. This would suggest that song plates were occasionally used to try and maximise profit. This song deals with emigration from Ireland to Scotland in a much more direct and open manner than many of the other songs on this theme.

It was published by Robert M'Intosh of Glasgow.
'Kathleen Mavourneen' is a song narrated by someone imploring his lover to awake before he has to leave her and Ireland for ever. Song of parting were common in broadside ballads, and the narrators were often men facing transportation or preparing to join the army. Here, the narrator's reasons for leaving are not given, but as it is an Irish ballad it is likely that he is being forced to emigrate for economic reasons. Both Ireland and the Scottish Highlands experienced large-scale emigration in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, especially during periods of crop failure.

It was published by James Lindsay of 11 King Street, Glasgow, and probably sold for one penny.
Although no publication date has been included on this broadside, it is thought to have been published between 1860 and 1894 - the years during which Lindsay had premises at 11 King Street. 'John Reilly' combines two popular themes found in many traditional ballads, those of tragic love and emigration. The ballad ends on a rather predictable note, with the star-crossed lovers perishing on the high seas.

Although this ballad starts off as if it were a lyrical love song written during the Romantic era, the tone soon changes as it reveals itself instead to be a song of mourning. The song is dedicated to a young wife called Mary who, along with her infant child, died from starvation in Ireland. The husband concludes the ballad by promising that, although he is emigrating to a new land, he will never forget his wife or 'Old Ireland'.

15333,emigration,L.C.Fol.74(078),"This broadside begins: 'A Full, True, and Particular Account of the LAST SPEECH, CONFESSION, and DYING DECLARATION of JOHN MURDOCK, (one of the Emigrants who lately left this country for America) who was Executed at Brockville, in Upper Canada . . . for the Horrible, Barbarous, and Inhuman Murder of his own Brother, by knocking him on the head with a large Axe, and afterwards Burying him Alive, while Cutting Timber in the Woods together.' The sheet was published in 1821, probably in Scotland. It is unusual for a story of this nature to travel so far.
These words were purportedly written by John Murdock, or Murdoch, although it is unlikely that he actually wrote the piece. The language is rather more elegant than would normally be expected from a poor convict. It is more likely to have been the work of an enterprising publisher. After detailing the grisly crime, and confessing that he wanted to kill his brother's wife also, 'Murdock' asks for forgiveness.
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers. Crimes could generate sequences of sheets covering descriptive accounts, court proceedings, last words, lamentations and executions as they occurred. As competition was fierce, immediacy was paramount, and these occasions provided an opportunity for printers and patterers to maximise sales.",Broadside entitled 'Horrible Confession!',1821
15086,emigration,L.C.Fol.70(111a),"This ballad begins: 'T'is just ten years ago, / Since I left my native home, / And oh how my mother wept, / When last she shook my hand.' The text preceding it reads: 'Copies of this song can always be had at the Poets Box 190 Overgate Dundee. / PRICE ONE PENNY'.
These sheets all mainly sold for a penny each regardless of which century they were printed in. This perhaps illustrates the cost effectiveness of the changes made within the printing industry. The sheets were occasionally made more attractive for their price by including two stories or songs. Here, however, the high drama and emotion were perhaps enough to sell this as compelling entertainment.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

It was to be sung to the original tune, suggesting that both the song and melody were well-known, and was published in 1869 by the Poet's Box, 80 London Street, Glasgow.
This ballad recounts the arrival of a young Irishman in Scotland, 'Where beauty shines on every side'. He encounters a young woman on the banks of the Clyde and after reassuring her that he is betrothed to another, and poses no threat, they walk arm in arm. As is so often the case in such ballads, however, the young man disappears after persuading the young woman to compromise her morals. With mass emigration to Scotland from Ireland during the years of industrialisation, references to Ireland were common in Scottish broadsides.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?!

The second ballad begins: 'It's of a fearless highwayman a story I will tell, / his name was William Brennan in Ireland he did dwell'.
Both songs are about foreign places, perhaps making them more exotic to the audience. They are also both about leaving loved ones, although the first character is emigrating and the second, the highwayman, is to die. The latter, William Brennan was hanged in Cork in 1804. Sheets were often printed with two songs, often only distantly related like this one, to make them a more attractive purchase - more goods for your money.",Broadside ballads entitled 'The girl I left behind me' and 'Brennan on the moor',1870-1890

This ballad published by the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee, combines traditional verse and chorus with a spoken reminiscence recounting a particularly drunken night. It tells of one man's last 'jolly spree' before he sets sail for distant shores. With the Scottish diaspora of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, such themes were extremely popular and struck a chord with many of those left behind.

'Erin Go Bragh' is Irish for 'Ireland Forever'.
There appears to be some doubt over the authorship of 'The Exile of Erin'. Many believe it to be the work of the Scottish-born poet, Thomas Campbell (1777-1844), who is said to have been inspired by an encounter with an Irish exile named McCann. It has also been suggested, however, that it was the work of the Irish ballad writer George Nugent Reynolds (1770-1802).

It was published on the 24th June 1871, probably in Glasgow.
Many of the sheets which were published by the Poet's Boxes across Scotland, had part of their addresses blacked out or cut out at a later date. The reason for this is largely unclear. It possible, however, that surplus stock from one shop was shipped around the country, to boost profits. Local news and items of interest would probably have sold quicker and so perhaps the more distant address was scratched out to improve sales.

The notice is dated 20th January 1849, and was published by J. Durham of Dundee on behalf of the Government Emigration Office in Dundee.
This is a government notice inviting applications for assisted emigration to the Cape of Good Hope, in South Africa. Emigration Societies were formed across the United Kingdom during the nineteenth century, to financially assist people who wished to emigrate to Canada, Australia, or Africa. The places most associated with assisted emigration schemes are Ireland and the Scottish Highlands. In these areas livelihoods were still heavily dependent on an unpredictable rural economy, and many landowners were keen to clear the land of people to develop large-scale livestock farming. This advertisement, however, is aimed at people in Dundee and Forfarshire.
Broadsides are single sheets of paper, printed on one side, to be read unfolded. They carried public information such as proclamations as well as ballads and news of the day.

Both these ballads deal with emigration from Scotland. The first deals with criminal transportation, and the second with bonded passage and labour. This sheet is rather unusual as these explicitly Scottish poems were published in Durham.

It was published by the Poet's Box of Dundee.
A common theme of broadside ballads, especially moving into the nineteenth century, was emigration, and this ballad is a good example of the tradition. The singer is leaving his love, Kitty, and his country, 'Erin', another name for Ireland, to make his fortune. Many modern folk songs retain this theme.

This ballad tells the story of parting lovers, and highlights the fears they have regarding the likelihood that they may never meet again.  The reference to winning 'glory and fame' possibly suggests that the man is about to leave and fight in a war. The author of the ballad, Allan Ramsay, had Jacobite sympathies. The ballad itself is quite inventive in its use of poetic imagery, with the sea tempests that the man is about to face during the imminent journey being imaginatively employed to convey the stormy nature of his inner turmoil.

This ballad was published by the Poet's Box, 190 Overgate, Dundee.
This ballad is narrated by a man preparing to leave Ireland and his sweetheart Kitty. The name 'Erin', used in the chorus of this ballad, is a poetic name for Ireland, derived from the Irish  'Eire', which is still used today. Ballads about leaving Ireland were not uncommon. In the eighteenth and in particular the nineteenth centuries, emigration from the largely rural island was very high. Some migrants crossed the Atlantic, but many others came to industrialising Scotland, hence the number of Irish songs to be found in Scottish broadsides.

The tragic fire aboard the paddle steamer, the 'Montreal', broke out on the 26th June 1857, en route from Quebec to Montreal. Among the passengers were 250 Scottish men, women and children who had just disembarked from the 'John MacKenzie', which had brought them from Scotland. Despite attempts to guide the boat into shallow waters, and the rescue efforts of another boat carrying emigrants, nearly 250 people lost their lives. With so many Scottish people involved in the disaster, it would have provoked a lot of interest and concern back home in Scotland.

This moving ballad is narrated by a young man trying to persuade his sweetheart to emigrate with him from the Highlands to the United States or Canada. Vast numbers of Highlanders emigrated west during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Emigration was greatest in times of hunger, such as the harvest failures of 1771-2 and 1782 and the potato blight of 1845-6. In the latter period many emigrant ships were controversially funded by landlords keen to clear tenants off their land. Close-knit Gaelic communities descended from these Scottish immigrants still exist in modern Canada.

'Bonny Nelly Brown' is the name of the sweetheart lamented by the narrator of this song. The phrases 'To' oceans wide between us roar' and 'They tell me Nelly Brown, that your bonny yellow hair, / Is snaw-white now . . .' suggest that the narrator had to emigrate from Scotland many years prevously, and that he only now receives news of Nelly Brown from friends back home. Emigration due to poverty was a common phenomenon in eighteenth and nineteenth century Scotland, and this, and lost love, were popular subjects for broadside ballads.

The chorus begins: 'For I am forced to go, my love / Where no one shall me know'. Included at the top of the sheet is a woodcut illustration of a man and woman holding hands. The word 'Kangaroo' is from the title of another ballad that appeared on the same sheet: 'On Board the Kangaroo'.
'The Bonnie Lassie's Answer' also appears on another broadside in the National Library of Scotland's collection, featuring a different woodcut. It tells the tale of a young man who, for the want of money, has been forced to enter into military service. Before leaving, he bids farewell to the country he loves, his parents and his sweetheart. Each time he says goodbye to his bonnie lassie, her sweet refrain is 'no, no'.

'Barnies' is a misprint, it should read 'bairnies'; a Scots word for 'children'. This sheet was published by the Poet's Box, Dundee.
This ballad deals with the subject of the passing of time, and fond memories of people or places now gone. The only contemporary reference to help us date it is that the singer mentions loved ones who have 'to the Indies gone'. Scottish emigration to the West Indies began in 1611, but increased after the 1707 Act of Union eliminated restrictions on trade between the Indies and the American colonies. The song was written by Lady Nairne, Carolina Oliphant (1766-1845) of Gask House, Perthshire. The 'auld hoose' was her ancient family home, replaced with a more modern building c.1800. Because she was a woman of high status, her songs were first published anonynously. She was the author of numerous well known songs, including; Wi' a Hundred Pipers, Charlie is my Darling, Laird o' Cockpen, Caller Herrin', Land o' the Leal, etc.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

It was to be sung to the air 'Farewell to Albion's Heathery Hills'. The broadside was priced at one penny and published by the Poet's Box (probably in Glasgow). A long advertisement for services offered by the Poet's Box foots the sheet, but the address and town are not included.
Parting was a popular theme for ballads. In some cases the parting might be between two people, in others, as in this ballad, the narrator might be leaving his or her native country. Military service, transportation or emigration for economic reasons were the most common reasons for people leaving. In this ballad, however, none of these factors are touched upon, and the atmospheric last verse hints that the journey symbolised here is the final journey of death.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were.

It was published by Robert McIntosh of 96 King Street, Calton, Glasgow, and probably sold for one penny.
Unusually, this ballad tells the tale of an American stranger arriving in a foreign country - in this case probably Scotland. A common theme for many of the broadside ballads published in Scotland was that of Scots emigrating to distant shores. This sheet, however, provides the reader with the lesser-known tale of an American arriving in Scotland. It is accompanied by a woodcut illustration of a young man selling wares.

There are at least three other broadside reports covering this story from its occurrence to the acquittal of Stuart. Sir Alexander Boswell (son of the biographer James Boswell) was an active Tory politician, mainly in Devon, England, although he was also actively involved in Scottish literary life. He operated a private printing press from his house in Auchinleck and was involved in the publicly-funded Burns memorial. He also indulged in publishing anonymous lampoons in the press, which sparked this challenge. Stuart discovered the name of his satirist whilst taking action against the 'Glasgow Sentinel'.

Alexander Boswell (1775-1822) was the son of the celebrated Scottish diarist and biographer James Boswell. He made important contributions to Scottish literature in his own right, collecting and publishing folk songs, founding a printing press and erecting a monument to Robert Burns on the banks of the River Doon. He also published sketches and poetry under the pseudonym 'Simon Gray'. The circumstances of his death inspired a scene in Sir Walter Scott's novel 'St Ronan's Well'.

This broadside reports only the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the death of Sir Alexander Boswell, antiquary, poet and son of James Boswell, the biographer. The end of the account comments that James Stuart was awaiting his trial. This is a typical format for broadsides - a story being reported in instalments as the action happens.

The sheet was printed by William Carse of Glasgow.
This trial caught the imagination of the people, as James Stewart appears to have been an important man; many of his friends present at the trial were advocates and eminent people of the day. He was found not guilty after an eighteen-hour trial which finished at five o'clock in the morning. This was a unanimous, and very popular, verdict.
The reason for the duel was that Boswell, who was incidentally the eldest son of Samuel Johnson's biographer, wrote a satire called 'The New Whig Song' which offended Stuart who challenged him.",Broadside entitled 'The Late Dual',1822
16583,emigration,L.C.Fol.73(094),"This broadside begins: 'Copy of a very Curious Letter from a Cotton Spinner in Canada, to his friends in this Country, containing a particular invitation to all men going out to America to take a Cotton Mill Lass along with him, as they make the far best Wives there; with many other curious particulars.' The broadside was published by John Muir of Glasgow and is dated 12th February 1827. Damage to the paper makes it quite difficult to read.
Allegedly written by a cotton spinner exiled in Canada, this 'letter' focuses almost entirely on the poor hygiene and housework standards of his friend's wife. The cotton spinner concludes that uncleanliness is a trait of 'country lasses', and that any Scotsman looking for a wife should wed a mill girl. It is likely that the letter is not genuine, but propaganda relating to a debate that was ongoing in Scotland in the early nineteenth century about the role of women. The most famous contributor to this was Elizabeth Hamilton, whose successful didactic novel 'The Cottagers of Glenburnie' (1808) stereotyped Scottish rural wives as lazy and 'clarty'. The latter word became very popular and recurs in this broadside.

Was unfortunately Shot through the Heart on the first fire, and instantly expired.' The broadside, which was priced at one penny, also includes a shorter report headed 'Fire'. The publisher is given as 'John Gullagher', and the place of publication is not noted.
The duel described here is believed to be the last to have taken place in Scotland. David Lansdale withdrew his business from the Bank of Scotland where Morgan worked after Morgan had allegedly discussed Lansdale's financial affairs with another client. Infuriated by Lansdale's decision, Morgan challenged Landsale to fight. The duel took place in a field at Cardenbarns Farm, Cardenden, near Kirkcaldy. Lansdale was later acquitted of Morgan's murder at the High Court in Edinburgh, after a skilful defence by his lawyers.

There are very few details included in this report, which was derived from a short notice in a Greenock newspaper, and it may be that the details are inaccurate. Alexander Montgomerie, the 10th Earl of Eglinton, was shot and killed in October 1769 during a confrontation with an excisemen and persistent poacher, Mungo Campbell. Although this was not strictly a duel, nor did it involve a young lady or a Captain Gordon, it seems to be the only record of one of the earls of Eglinton dying a violent death, suggesting that rumours surrounding the earl's death reached the early newspapers before the facts did. The incident features in John Galt's classic novel of Ayrshire life, 'Annals of the Parish', first published in 1821.

This story is centred on the love triangle between John Clod, Peggy and Peter Simple - meaningful fictitious names! John and Peter's fight for Peggy's attention brings them both to a duel - where their friends play a joke on them and no-one gets hurt - and Peggy is so offended and shocked that she doesn?t get out of bed afterwards. The whole story is really quite funny. Information on the everyday life of servants in their society is also revealed in this text.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington (1769-1852), was the last Prime Minister to fight a serious duel. It was over his support of Catholic Emancipation. That duel, in which no-one was hurt, was with Lord Winchelsea, in 1829, about the same time as this piece. However, in the duel mentioned here, Wellington was killed and the opponent's last name doesn't fit.
The sheet goes on to report on the troubles in Ireland, which Wellington was embroiled in. It ends with a rather gruesome story, also from Ireland, about a former policeman who had lost his job after being caught in a brothel.  The resultant distress proved too much and he murdered his two young daughters by beheading them. He then killed himself.",Broadside entitled 'Dreadful Duel!',1829

At the top of the sheet it mentions that the song was first printed in Chambers's Journal, No. 175, and was written by an old spinster 'as a kind of burlesque of her own habits and history'. The tune is similar to 'The Laird of Cockpen'.
Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, which was called Chambers's Journal after 1854, was a hugely popular nineteenth-century journal of literature, science and the arts. It was founded by Robert Chambers (1802-71) in 1832 and ran until 1938. Cribbing songs and news reports was common practice among broadside publishers looking to make a quick profit, and copyright laws were not so strict then as they are today.

Judging by the title of this light-hearted ballad, it must have been a reply to some previous broadsides that caused offence to the fairer sex. In response, the writer highlights many aspects of male behaviour that show men to be creatures of ridicule. Particularly delightful is the imaginative manner in which the usual epic and heroic metaphors (Hercules) employed in much eighteenth century poetry, are subverted for humorous and satirical effect. The tone and style of this ballad, combined with the use of rhyming couplets, is strongly reminiscent of the writings of poets such as Alexander Pope.

The text preceding it reads: 'An excellent New Song, Much in request'.
This is an interesting glimpse of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Scottish society. During this period, first civil and then foreign wars dominated politics. Scots were renowned for travelling abroad both as soldiers and as mercenaries. Here, fears for loved ones are voiced, perhaps a theme that would have been familiar to the audience. There is a further look at this period's attitude towards materialistic finery and fashions, as the lover's dress is described in detail.

This woodcut can be found on other broadsides held in the National Library of Scotland's collection. It was quite common for woodcut blocks to be used across a wide range of sheets as they were expensive to create and so had to be used to maximum benefit. The outlay for the block, however, was off-set against the increase in perceived value of the sheet. Not only was it more decorative, but those people who were illiterate and enjoying the sheet read to them, could also derive benefit in the sheet. This image with its exotic palm trees and unusual character would probably have been an attractive purchase.

'John of Landwart's Dream' is a comical, if by today's standards deeply misogynist, tirade against the clothes and jewellery worn by women. It was apparently inspired by a trip the narrator once took to Edinburgh. The poem is written in a highly energetic Scots, and after the first verse, which acts as a sort of preface, the metre and rhyme schemes change, from rhyming couplets of equal length, to a pattern of three longer, rhyming lines followed by a short fourth, with the short fourth lines rhyming in pairs.

Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites. The term 'ballad' eventually applied more broadly to any kind of topical or popular verse.","Broadside ballad entitled 'John of Landwart's Dream upon the High-Cock-Upps; or, his Sentments of the Vain Apparel of the Female Sex'",1703

This piece is replying to satirical broadsides such as 'A New Proclamation Concerning Farthingles, or Old Mr Fashoner Shiting Hopt-piticoats', which is also in the National Library of Scotland's collection. Hooped petticoats became fashionable early in the eighteenth century and it is likely that this sheet dates from around that time. The author cleverly turns the argument around by pointing out how the men's fashion is hardly any better, with ''wigs of such an antique Size' and 'Hats that seem design'd for Hercules'!

This broadside was published by the Poet's Box, Glasgow, and could be purchased for one penny. Below the song, the services of the 'Poet' - that is, the Poet's Box - are advertised and offered 'on the most moderate terms'. There was a Poet's Box in most of Scotland's major towns. Apart from publishing their 'stock' items, they also accepted commissions and provided struggling authors with the opportunity to have their work published cheaply.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

The ballad was published by the Poet's Box, 224 Overgate, Dundee. The reference to a railway line into Glasgow dates this ballad to 1831 at the earliest.
This ballad is based around a common subject in Scottish writing in the eighteenth and especially nineteenth centuries, the idea that cities were dangerous and immoral places compared to the countryside. This theme was used, often humorously, by the famous Ayrshire writers Robert Burns and John Galt. The 'Kilmarnock Bonnet' of the title is a famous piece of headgear, dating back at least to 1647, when the 'Kilmarnock Corporation of Bonnet Makers' was founded.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.

The partner of this is, unfortunately, untraceable. There are no publication details given, but this is one of two songs - printed by James Lindsay - on this sheet. 
Women's fashions are a popular topic amongst broadside authors, especially criticising or satirising them. Any sort of hooped skirt meant that men had restricted access to a woman's body, which often hindered his amorous intent. A greater concern for moralists was that crinolines and other hooped skirts tended to tip up and show more of the lady's leg than was proper. Farthingales were another fashion which caused outrage.",Broadside entitled 'Answer to Ladies Crinolines',1852-1859

'BARR, LONDON STREET, GLASGOW' is printed at the bottom of the sheet.
Jeanie Deans, 'the cow-feeder's daughter', was the heroine of Walter Scott's 'The Heart of Midlothan' (1818). This song outlines her journey on foot to London to obtain a pardon for her sister, Effie.  At least one other version of this broadside, entitled 'Jeanie Deans', can be found in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

The song was published by the Poet's Box of Dundee.
Emigration and missing one's homeland and loved ones was a common theme for broadsides, especially in the nineteenth century when emigration escalated. It is still an important element of the modern Scots and Irish folk tradition, especially in Canada and America. Unlike many of the songs, which are really laments, here the singer has made the decision to return to Scotland to be reunited with his loved one.

This song is to be sung to the tune of 'Lord Bateman's Daughter'. It was published by the Poet's Box of Overgate, Dundee, and cost a penny.
This song begins very traditionally. A man meets a poor working girl and offers her riches if she goes away with him. She refuses to forsake her sailor, though he has been away for seven years. The story then deviates from tradition when it transpires that the man is captain of the ship her lover left on, and he rewards her faithfulness with a gold ring. This song is very similar to 'Collier Laddie', which has a more traditional ending where the girl's loyalty is not rewarded!

This ballad addresses a favourite ballad theme, courtship and marriage with a sudden but inspiring lover. As with most of these poems though, consummation upon the promise of marriage is taken for granted. It is now thought, through the study of early church marriage and baptismal registers that over half this country's women were six months pregnant when they stood at the altar.

The other is a dove of hope carrying an olive branch of peace.
Both woodcuts and the lyrics were often used to send a moral message to the populace and offer guidance and advice to the audience. Many authors, printers and distributors saw themselves as society's guardians and so took on a more community spirited role.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The Bloody Gardener's Cruelty' or 'The Shepherd's Daughter Betray'd',1700-1710

The sheet was printed on Saturday June 7th, 1873, and cost one penny.
Bathed in romantic moonlight, the young man who narrates this lyrical ballad is addressing his amorous lines to his sweetheart, who he likens to a 'blooming mountain rose'. Since the ballad-writer personifies the moon, the wind and other natural elements, it is a clever contrast to reverse this process by speaking of his love as a wild rose. The sheet also contains a catalogue of other songs that are available for purchase by post, and details regarding the procedure to do this. Underneath this advertisement, a further note states that the Poet's Box can publish any type of information, and is the cheapest printer in the city.

A note below the title states that this ballad was to be sung to an original tune. Sold for a penny, a further note below the title states that 'Copies can always be had in the Pos [Poet's] Box, 80 London Street, Glasgow'.
This ballad celebrates the central Romantic concept of young lovers being in tune with nature and each other. The ballad tells the story of a young man from the Highlands who having fallen in love with a young woman who lives in the Lowlands, asks her to go and live with him in the Highlands. At this time, however, there existed a strong element of mistrust between the people of these two regions. Thus, the girl's father states that he will not allow his daughter to travel with her lover to the Highlands. Happily, however, love triumphs over all obstacles, and the young man and the father are eventually reconciled - thus opening the door for a symbolic marriage between Highlands and Lowlands.

The Birks of Abergeldy was a popular country dance, a reel involving three couples, during the early eighteenth century. The lyricist and composer of the piece have not been recorded, but the first recorded appearance of the melody was in 1692. It had been published south of the border by 1700. The lyrics were famously rewritten by Burns when he stayed at Aberfeldy in Perthshire. Those lyrics were originally entitled, 'The Birks o' Aberfeldy'.

'Lave' in this context is the word for 'guillemots', who are renowned for choosing and remaining with only one mate, and 'birken' is the Scots words for 'birch'. There are no publication details given, but this is one of two songs - printed by James Lindsay - on this sheet. 
The woodcut at the top of the sheet, although clear and detailed, is still quite rough and ready. This illustration, although not directly related to the lyrics, is supposed to enhance the atmosphere of 'The Birken Tree'. The idea expressed in the woodcut of a hard-working, wholesome country lass is carried through into the text. The text deals with a common theme amongst broadsides, that of sneaking out when mother has forbade it. Here, however, a happy ending is included, with Jean and Johnny enjoying a happy life together.

This romantic ballad is structured on a running dialogue between two young lovers, Johnny and Jean. Johnny is trying to woo the suspicious Jean, and wants to arrange a meeting underneath a birch tree. Known as the 'Lady of the Woods', the birch tree is an ancient Celtic symbol of innocence, fidelity and the immortality of the soul. The ballad climaxes with a meeting between the two young lovers underneath the birch tree, where they pledge their love for one another.

'Betsey of Dundee' is narrated by a sailor who returns to his native Dundee after fighting overseas. Upon his return, the young sailor meets Betsey and falls hopelessly in love with her. Whilst her father initially disapproves of the match, he eventually acquiesces and Betsey and the sailor are wed. Whilst 'Betsey of Dundee' follows a common theme found in many early ballads, mainly that of love involving a returning or departing sailor, the end is something of a surprise. In most other cases, the young couple either elope and tragically die en route or the young suitor meets a grisly end at the hands of his sweetheart's father. Here, however, Betsey and the sailor appear to live happily ever after.

In a T.V and radio-less society singing and sporting together was one of the few forms of entertainment. These sheets were supposed to be shared amongst a wide audience, being cheap to buy and often stuck onto walls. As a result competition for sales could be fierce.

The symbols are fairly apt for Dundee, which had a busy harbour, surrounded by a fertile and rolling, rural hinterland.

There are many broadside ballads offering 'helpful' advice to any man who is considering matrimony. In most of these works, men are warned against gossiping, deceitful, slothful and drunken women. The overriding message appears to be that a good, honest woman is hard to find. Although the majority of these ballads were intended to be humorous, the persistent portrayal of women as the tormentors of man offers an interesting insight into eighteenth- and nineteenth-century attitudes towards women.

Mr McGuire, it is revealed, owns a farm, and as a result Katy's mother is desperate for the courtship to go well. Katy, however, has a smaller brother, who unaware perhaps of the gravity of the situation, sees this as an opportunity to blackmail Mr McGuire so Katy will not 'hear' of his previous courtships. Nowhere in the song is Katy given a voice! Although set in Ireland, the nature of the topic and humour used would probably have appealed to wide audience.

The broadside does not carry the name of its publisher, nor the place or date of publication.
Initially this appears to be a conventional love song, featuring a young man asking his sweetheart to walk with him in beautiful countryside. However, as the song develops, it describes an industrialised Leven valley, rich in overseas trade but also marked by poverty. The idea for a contemporary realist love song about the area may have been formed in reaction to Tobias Smollett's (1721-71) 'To Leven Water', which is a far more traditional and picturesque romantic ballad.

This ballad which is also known as ?The Banks of Inverurie? is one which remains popular in Scotland to this day. It is about a young man who sees a beautiful young woman on the ?banks of Inverury? and determines to marry her in spite of her protestations.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

16596,courtship,RB.m.168(021),"Verse 1 begins: 'As I walkt out one morning, adored as I did pass, / On the banks of Inverary I met a bonny lass'. It was published by Batchelar of Long Alley, probably in London. The woodcut at the top of the sheet is supposed to look like a coat of arms, which would have imbued the sheet with a perceived air of authority.
Meeting a lovely girl on the banks of a river is a fairly common plot amongst Scottish ballads. Yet the romantic, idyllic and peaceful nature of the plot would probably have had widespread and enduring appeal. The theme of chaste and virtuous behaviour is also common amongst broadsides and there is a real fear of innocent women becoming the victims of seduction. Broadsides were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative. Broadside authors also tended to see themselves as moral guardians and teachers in society.

She was then reduced to poverty . . . and on Monday last, was found in a most deplorable condition, lying dead in a byre near mid Calder, together with a copy of an interesting Letter, and also a Copy of Verses . . . in her own hand writing.' This sheet was published by Francis McCartney.
There follows a copy of the letter supposedly found on Miss Watson, and of the verses she apparently wrote. In the letter she bemoans the loss of 'the brightest gem of the female character', her virginity, and expresses sadness and shame over her pregnancy. The verses are reasonably well-composed, although should not be taken as being Miss Watson's. Broadside publishers were not averse to fabricating last words, confessions and other personal statements, if it meant it would sell more copies.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

The broadside was published by the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee'. At the bottom of the sheet a mail order service for songs is advertised.
This ballad tells the story of a music-loving widow who is enchanted by the playing of a passing fiddler, and invites him to stay with her, an invitation he accepts. Ballads were frequently concerned with romantic or sexual matters, and it is probable that, in this example, the music and the playing of musical instruments were intended as metaphors for sexual attraction and sexual activity.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.

Printed by Kirkwood in Glasgow.
This broadsheet combines a mixture of literary styles, including a general introduction, a personal account of her tragedy seemingly written by Agnes Rae herself, and an instructional ballad to conclude the sheet. The broadsheet tells of how Miss Rae was led astray and seduced by a young gentleman, and how this situation left her poverty and caused her subsequent death. It is possible that this broadsheet is a work of fiction, intended as a moral code of practice and warning to make young people behave themselves.

In this ballad, Macpherson Rab is advised by the Laird o' Glentosh to leave the parish because of his philandering ways. It is suggested that he move to an area where 'The population stood in need, need, need- / The kintra stood in need.' It is suggested by this and by 'his size and the shape o' his weel-fill'd breeks' that his behaviour is inevitable and will continue wherever he may be. Certainly, the ballad ends with Rab working near the Clyde 'Whaur, dootless, the wives and the lasses a' / Are praying he lang may abide, bide, bide - / Are praying he aye may abide.' Whilst the ballad clearly deals with the subject of virility, it also highlights the positive female reaction and interest in Rab's sexual prowess.

The text before this reads: 'Printed by T. Birt. 10 Great St Andrews Street wholesale and retail, Seven Dials, London. Country Orders punctually attended to.'
One of Birt's sales points is that people in the countryside can rely on a quick service - perhaps suggestive of Londoners' attitude to their hinterland. It is also curious to note that this extension of Burns's reputation was being sold in London. Presumably the poem refers to Jean Armour, Burns's wife after a long informal relationship. Unfortunately, the high ideals expressed in this poem were typical of this relationship and Burns is never known to have fought in a war.

The text preceding it reads: 'PRICE ONE PENNY / This Popular Song can always be had at the Poet's Box, 190 Overgate, Dundee.'
Most broadsides sold for a penny, although this price was sometimes made more attractive by including two songs or stories on the one sheet. They were usually sold in the street by vendors who sang the song to attract attention. This theme of love separated by the sea may have been a popular theme in Dundee due to its thriving docks. This dockside and long-distance trade, unfortunately, no longer exists.

The text preceding it reads: 'ALLAN WATER: / OR, A / LOVER / IN/ CAPTIVITY: / A NEW SONG: / Sung with a pleasant New Air.'
There are various tunes honoured with 'Allan Water' but the earliest recorded version dates to 1692. Tradition stipulates that the name is derived from the river at Strathallan, Perthshire. The words to this tune also vary from record, but most of them share the theme of Anny's virtues. There are other more factual texts in the National Library of Scotland's collection, which also reveal eighteenth- and nineteenth-century attitudes towards love and courtship.

This song was to be sung to an 'Original' tune, and could be bought for one penny. It was published on 9th May 1868 by the Poet's Box, probably in Glasgow.
This comic ballad is quite strikingly evocative of the social life of a wealthy Victorian bachelor. The scenes in the ballroom mention the different dances that take place, as well as describing the varieties of wine and types of food on offer. The ballad also reflects the comparatively chaste attitudes to romance that prevailed in Victorian times, as the narrator is disgraced publicly for trying to 'steal a kiss'. By contrast, some ballads dating from the eighteenth century have much bawdier contents.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were.

A note below the title states that this ballad was 'Sung by Charles Oswald, with immense success', and that 'This popular song can be had at the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee'.
This light-hearted ballad tells of a young man's frustration at the behaviour of his sweetheart's little brother, who runs to inform his parents whenever the two lovers start to become slightly amorous. It appears that, upon realising that there is significant financial profit to be had from chaperoning, the entrepreneurial little brother begins to blackmail his sister's sweetheart. The ballad's verses are sung by the young suitor, while the intrusive chorus is sung by the little brother. The inclusion of the singer's name on the broadside perhaps indicates the gradual evolution towards a vaudeville culture.

Although not dated, the sheet was published in Edinburgh by Sanderson.
This wonderful broadside proves that, even in olden days, people understood the concept of text messaging and using symbolic emoticons. Allegedly written and designed by a love-struck artist for his sweetheart the hieroglyphic code of the letter is quite easy to decipher. To read the letter, the audience just has to replace the missing letters with the given symbol. For example, the opening line reads 'Dear Isabella', with the woodcuts of a deer and a bell replacing the missing syllables. Decoding the symbols at the end implies that the letter was written by 'Archibald Wilke'. This broadside is quite similar to the word and symbol puzzles that regularly appear in today's newspapers.

Although the tone and moral stance of the text is in quite bad taste today, it is revealing of attitudes of the time. Courtship, marriage, affairs, status and social consequences are all explored here.
This type of record gives the working-class layer of society a unique voice. Most types of formal historical record are kept to ensure ownership and power, and so are written by those in power.

It appears that the sender, Archibald Wilkie, was in competition with another suitor for Isabella's affections. He urges her not to listen to any rumours she might have heard, but to meet him beside her master's gate at 8 o'clock on Sunday. The charm of this letter is to be found in the use of the hieroglyphs, without which it would probably have elicited very little interest.

The broadside was published by Brown of Edinburgh. Although its publication date is not printed on the sheet, a later hand has written the date in as April 1844.
Public bareknuckle fighting was not uncommon in the nineteenth century, and reports of fights often appeared in broadsides. Fights were generally reported in a distinctive colloquial vocabulary, as phrases like 'dexter ogle' and 'pepper-box' illustrate here. In some cases the fights were contested for large purses, and attracted bets on their outcomes, anticipating the more regulated professional boxing that became hugely popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The fight described in this broadside, on the other hand, appears to have been more a matter of honour between two men in love with the same woman. Traditionally, among the upper classes, a similar matter might have been settled by a duel with swords or pistols.

This sheet was printed for John Thom of Edinburgh and sold for the price of a penny a sheet.
Due to the wide audience which was reached by broadsides they were often used as forums for moralisation. The vast amount of detail and the stilted and formal nature of the letters suggest that some of the information here should be treated with a pinch of salt. The innocent nature of the victim and dreadful predicament would have made compulsive reading, no doubt!
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers. Crimes could generate sequences of sheets covering descriptive accounts, court proceedings, last words, lamentations and executions as they occurred. As competition was fierce, immediacy was paramount, and these occasions provided an opportunity for printers and patterers to maximise sales.",Broadside entitled 'Fatal Love!',1823

The suicide of a young girl who had been seduced then abandoned by her lover is presented in this broadside as a warning to other would-be seducers. It is stated that the suicide note included in the report 'may be depended upon as genuine', but it is probable that the letter was written, or greatly revised, by the broadside author after the event. The victim was a servant girl, who is unlikely to have had the command of written English demonstrated in the letter. The publication of 'last words' attributed to a suicide victim or condemned murderer but often actually composed by an anonymous author, were common in broadsides that sought to issue moral guidance.

Printed for James Taylor, Edinburgh.
Opening with a quick hellfire sermon, this broadside tells the tragic story of two 'star-crossed lovers', and the cruel fate that apparently befell them when true love was not allowed to run its course. It is difficult to know whether this broadside story is loosely based on some incident from real life, or if it is just fiction intended for moral instruction. For while common names and general locations are included, the style and tone of the writing is very much that of an eighteenth century parable.

The broadside was originally published by A. Jones of Dundee, and reprinted in Edinburgh.
Moral instruction was a common feature of broadsides. Most often accounts of executions would be used by broadside editors to warn people against leading immoral lives, and these frequently included dying speeches attributed to the condemned but more likely written by the broadside author or editor. In this broadside the suicide of a young woman seduced and abandoned by her lover provides the moral lesson. Here it is not possible to tell whether the suicide note is genuine or the work of the broadside author. Although suicides were less frequently used than executions for moral teaching, there are other similar broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

The letter is signed 'John Slink' and the sheet carries a woodcut illustration of an idyllic landscape.
The main point of this text seems to be John Slink's complete lack of finances despite his determination to have the world think he is of the nobility and well-moneyed. This he does principally through credit. Other insights into society are given, however, with the Botanical Gardens being mentioned: the dandy walks in them on a Sunday, and his lady was seen walking out with her friend there. Valentines and pieces of clothing are also alluded to.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

Illustrated with a relevant woodcut, this erudite broadside, written in verse form, comprises a lively Socratic dialogue between a bachelor (of undetermined age) and an old maiden. This dialogue is quite philosophical in tone, and centres around the bachelor's efforts to find out why the old maiden has never married - perhaps revealingly, the bachelor does not have to explain why he is not married. The playful dialogue then climaxes with an offer of proposal from the bachelor - a development that panics the old maiden. With the issue unresolved, the dialogue ends with the bachelor singing a song and asking the old maiden just to 'name the day'.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.",Broadside entitled 'A Dialogue Between an Old Maiden & Bachelor',1820-1830

There are many of these anonymous love letters or 'Dear John' letters contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection - although much of their authenticity is to be questioned. Like many other broadsides, some of this songs appeal seems to lie in laughing at someone else's misfortunes, and the sardonic humour of a reverse love-letter. It could even have been a moral warning. Certainly there are other broadsides which detail stories of young women seduced by dashing cads and then left broken an pregnant.

Included at the top of the sheet is an illustration of a young woman, and a man on bended knee.
What then follows is an account of the rather trite dialogue between Emma and Thomas, the married gentleman and young lady of the title. Although they are obviously conducting an illict love affair, the conversation between the two is passionless and stultifying. Whilst published and distributed as a broadside, this dialogue was probably intended to be performed to an audience. The use of humorous voices and facial expressions during the retelling would have greatly enhanced its comedic value.

The event described here is the suicide of a young woman who had been seduced, made pregnant and then abandoned by her fiancé, who is alleged to have impregnated another young woman shortly afterwards. Even as late as the twentieth century, pregnancy outside wedlock was considered to be a matter of great shame in some areas of British society, and suicides among women in these circumstances were not uncommon, as this broadside suggests: 'almost every newspaper contains cases of a similar nature'. Reports of such cases tended to use very emotive languge to heighten the sense of tragedy, as in this example: 'she found her suspended by her silken scarf, a lifeless corpse.'

Unfortunately, no publication details are included on the sheet.
Although the title of this broadside claims that the sheet contains a love letter, albeit a curious one, the letter is in fact a spiteful letter of rejection to end a love affair. As such, it appears to be a rather unusual item to print, although it is true that no publisher ever went poor through underestimating the public's insatiable appetite for reading prurient gossip. Another curious aspect of this sheet is the short verse above the letter, which provides the audience with advice regarding how they should read this love epistle. In short, this appears to be a very strange broadside, and it would be interesting to learn how the audience of the day reacted to it.

It was printed by Forbes, possibly in the early nineteenth century, and probably sold for one penny.
It is unclear whether this was in fact genuine and, if it was, why it was worthy of publication as a broadside. Whilst it is now fairly commonplace for people to advertise for a friend or partner in a lonely-hearts column, perhaps in nineteenth-century Scotland it was less so. Scott seems rather preoccupied with finding a wife with a small personal fortune. If successful this could have proved extremely lucrative for him, since a woman's property and personal fortune automatically became her husband's upon marriage.

The broadside was priced at one penny and published by A. Turnbull. This is probably Andrew Turnbull & Co, a publisher based in Edinburgh's High Street in the nineteenth century.
The humour in this broadside is of the cruellest sort, especially if the story has any basis in fact. A young Highlander proposes marriage to an elderly, wealthy lady, then absconds with a large sum of her money, leaving her at the altar. The bride-to-be is presented an object of ridicule for her naivety and vanity in believing that the proposal mght be genuine. The would-be groom is a stereotypical Highlander, of the sort commonly found in satirical literature in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He is impoverished, dishonest and works as a night watchman, an unpopular vocation particularly associated with Highland migrants to Edinburgh.

The letter is signed with the initials, 'J.T.', while the sheet was published by Thomas Duncan of the Saltmarket, Glasgow.
This broadside contains a love letter written by a soldier serving overseas in Holland, to his sweetheart back home in Glasgow. The soldier reassures Mary that the war will soon be over, and that they will soon be reunited. There is no way of knowing if, as is claimed, this letter was in fact written by a soldier who was serving abroad. Indeed, in their efforts to maximise their profits, publishers of broadsides were quite ingenious in printing sheets on a wide range of subjects, which would appeal to the general public. So it is quite likely that this letter was instead written by an author who was employed by Thomas Duncan, the publisher of this broadside.

The individual responsible for this alternative love letter has taken the opportunity to vent their spleen towards what would traditionally have been the object of their affection. What begins to all intents and purposes as a genuine love letter, soon descends into a single-minded character assassination. These sentiments were probably far more popular with broadside readers than if they were those of a genuine love letter. It turns the notion of the traditional love letter on its head and, in doing so, makes for great comedy.

This topic, anonymous love letters and 'Dear Johns', seems to have been a popular broadside topic, although the appeal of this topic is perhaps a little more obscure to modern readers! Duncan Menzies the Printer is known to have worked out of the Lawnmarket  between 1812 and 1836. Previous to this he is thought to have worked with Robert Menzies, a partner or relative.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

Lindsay and Miss Mary Miller, and the broadside was published by Henry.
Although the appeal of such broadsides might be hard to understand for a modern-day audience, love letters and dialogues between lovers were popular amongst broadside readers. Often given a humorous or slightly illicit slant, they were often more about what was not being said on the page than what was. The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection contains a number of other 'love letters', including a rather novel one that makes use of hieroglyphics.

This ballad was written by Mr J Macguire of Dundee, and was to be sung to the air 'I'm lonely since my mother died'. It was published at 190 and 192 Overgate, Dundee, probably by the Poet's Box.
This ballad is narrated by someone whose sweetheart has apparently emigrated, leaving the narrator broken-hearted. There are a few unanswered questions raised by the song. We learn that the separation took place several years ago and that the narrator has not heard from his or her former lover since, yet the narrator is convinced the ex-lover 'cannot yet forget' the happiness they enjoyed together. Love lost was a popular subject for ballads, but often the history of the realtionship was recounted in more detail than in this case.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing.

This broadside recounts the tale of a country lass, seduced into an unmarried relationship and then rejected by her lover. As a result of her now unacceptable status she is forced into prostitution, whereupon she catches a fatal disease. Many broadsides and especially ballads show great concern about the seduction of innocent teenagers, although how widespread this problem was is debatable. There is also emphasis placed on the bad consequences of disobeying one's parents amongst many broadsides.

This well-written song focuses on a common theme of broadside ballads, and indeed of folk song throughout the ages: that of unrequited love.

This is one of the few examples in the National Library of Scotland's broadside collection where an author's name appears alongside a song. Whilst the publisher's name was often recorded, the author was usually omitted. This was partly to do with the lackadaisical approach broadside publishers had towards attributing work and also partly to do with the nature of the material. Many of the songs and ballads that appeared on broadsides had their roots in the oral tradition, whereby they were passed down through the generations, and, as a result, often bore no attribution.

The battle of Bothwell Bridge (or Brig) was fought on the 22nd June 1679 between Government forces, led by Sir John Graham of Claverhouse (also known as Bonnie Dundee), and a party of Covenanter forces. Previous to this the Archbishop of St Andrews, James Sharp, (1613-79) had been murdered on Magus Moor, Fife, by Covenanter assassins. They had then run riot through the streets of Strathaven.

This ballad celebrates the religion and virtues of the Duke of Monmouth (1649-1685), and the Duke of Buccleuch. Probably written in 1679, around the time of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge, this ballad compares Monmouth to Jesus Christ and his father, Charles II, to God. This ballad should ideally be viewed in the context of the bloody events that led up to the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Monmouth was beheaded at Tower Hill, London, following the defeat of his army at Sedgemoor in 1685.

This rare and interesting broadside tells, in verse form, how Archbishop James Sharp (1618-79) was murdered by Covenanters at Magnus Muir, just outside St Andrews. He was brutally stabbed 16 times in front of his daughter. There is a fine engraving illustrating the  murder, and the text refers to it with phrases such as: 'See, how the Coach-man Tumbles from his Box ; And poor Postillion fell'd, like Fatted Ox!'.

This is a ballad commemorating James M'Mourtrie, an old man who cleaned and repaired gravestones, and who was known as 'Old Mortality'. This nickname was almost certainly taken from the eponymous character in the first chapter of Sir Walter Scott's novel 'Old Mortality'. This character was an elderly native of Dumfries or Galloway who wandered southern Scotland, cleaning and repairing the graves of Covenanters who had been martyred during the reigns of Charles II and James VII and II.
The National Covenant was drawn up and signed by members of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1638. The Covenant denounced Roman Catholicism and asserted the Church's independence from the Episcopalianism practised by King Charles I and many of the nobles who supported him.

This ballad is an attack on the Covenanted Church of Scotland, represented here by a black cloak. The National Covenant was drawn up and signed by members of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1638. The Covenant reiterated the evils of Roman Catholicism and asserted the Church's independence from the Episcopalianism practised by King Charles I and many of the nobles who supported him. Ultimately, the Covenanters would be drawn into civil war against the Royalists, and this ballad blames the Covenanters for the eventual execution of Charles I as well as other evils done against Scotland.

A woodcut illustration of a man's head has been included at the top of the sheet.
In this ballad, John MacGill is approached by the local Minister to take up arms and fight in the name of religion. The Minister believes it is time to rise up again in defence of Presbyterianism. Reference is made to the defeat of the Covenanters at the battles of Rullion Green (1666) and Bothwell Brig (1679), where General Tam Dalyell and John Graham of Claverhouse, respectively, led government forces to victory. Both men had been appointed by Charles II to suppress the Covenanters in Scotland. Whilst John MacGill thinks it a worthy cause, he has no intention of fighting.

It was published in 1833.
The letter reproduced here, apparently from a condemned murderer to his lover, is one example of a popular topic in broadside literature, that of last words or deathbed repentance. Sometimes broadsides on this subject might take the form of a transcription of a condemned man's last words on the scaffold, while others might be in the form of a letter. A common element is the cautionary nature of the words spoken or wrtitten, as in this example where McCabe exhorts his lover to renounce her sins and embrace a Christian life. It is not really possible to prove the authenticity of McCabe's authorship.

It was printed by John Muir of Glasgow, in 1824.
Broadsides could vary in tone, and here the reporting is heavy in biblical imagery such as: 'your flesh food for the fowls of the air, and your bones bleached with the sun and rains of Heaven'. The portentous words are ascribed to the speeches of the judge and the convicted man, but it is likely that there was a certain amount of artistic licence on the part of the author. Broadside authors often assumed the role of moral guardians to their readers and it is even possible that the case described here is a fiction produced for moral instruction: the convict's name is not mentioned, which suggests he could be an invention.

Taylor's speech is intended as a warning to young people who have started breaking the law, that it is easy to get caught in a downward criminal spiral. Taylor's initial mistake was to get involved with the more 'dissolute' members of his profession. Before long, he had begun to involve himself in 'illicit practices' to support his drinking, and became an outcast in Perth, instead carrying out crimes in other towns. Eventually, these led to his arrest for housebreaking, and his death sentence.

Gilchrist, his brother William and another accomplice, James Brown, robbed the Commercial Bank of £5712, in total whilst it was being transported on the Glasgow-Edinburgh stagecoach. About £5,500 pounds of the money was recovered from the oddest places. The Gilchrist brothers had buried the money under a slab, which was surrounded by arsenic to stop the rats eating it. Brown on the other hand, hid his money in a gun barrel. Brown confessed to his part in the robbery, George was found guilty and William was returned a not proven verdict.

Gilchrist was tried along with his brother William and his accomplice James Brown for robbing the Commercial Bank of £5712 on the Glasgow-Edinburgh stage coach. The thieves broke through to the boot from the inside of the coach whilst disguised as women. They were eventually caught when they turned each other in, and after witnesses gave positive identifications. George and William were convicted but Brown turned 'crown evidence' and so escaped punishment. There was rumour at the time that the heist was planned by another famous thief, John Wilson, who was also under arrest, awaiting execution.

John Armstrong was a border riever and moss-trooper, who also indulged in blackmail and protection rackets, as far south as Newcastle. His base was his home at Gilnockie Hall, near Langholm and although gentry himself, he owed allegiance to the more powerful Lord Maxwell. In 1530 James V rode out to administer swift justice in the borders in response to English demands and threats. He hung Armstrong quickly and with no trial, despite Armstrong's demonstration of loyalty. It is now thought that the circumstances were engineered by Maxwell as he received Armstrong's lands not long after.

Copying or cribbing from newspaper sources was a relatively common occurrence in nineteenth century broadsides.

This sheet was re-printed by Douglas and Kent, Newcastle.
This sensational broadside tells the tragic story of two children who were accidentally poisoned by a Pied Piper and Fagin-like character, who traded Candy with children in return for whatever fancy ornaments they could lay their hands on. Asked by the magistrate to explain himself, it would seem that the candy somehow became mixed in some rat poison belonging to a rat-catcher who shared dwellings with the Candyman. Acquitted of the charge of murder, the Candyman was committed to trial for the handling of stolen goods. The strange fact that the Candyman is not named, lends a mythic quality to the story.

Also, the names of several respectable Manufacturers who were to have been assassinated, for which he was to receive £100.' The sheet was published in 1825 by William Carse of Glasgow.
This fascinating broadside offers its audience a glimpse into a murky underworld of politics, organised labour and political assassination. John Kean, a former cotton spinner, was publicly whipped and then transported to Australia for life, following his attempt to shoot John Graham. In short, Kean was a hitman, who had agreed to shoot several Manufacturers for £100 - about £4,500 in today's terms. Although the National Library of Scotland's collection contains broadsides regarding this sad tale, frustratingly, the whole story is not given. Jigsawing together the evidence, it appears that a recent Act of Parliament passed by Joseph Hume had affected the livelihoods of cotton spinners, and that they were taking direct action to resolve the issue.

A note at the foot of the sheet states that it was published by William Carse of Glasgow, while the story was sourced from 'The Glasgow Chronicle' of November the 15th. Unfortunately, the year of publication is not included.
This broadside tells of a despicable crime that was committed on a pair of young women, after they had been plied with alcohol and chemicals by a druggist and his friend. To protect the identities of the victims, presumably, the names of the two accused men and the location of the crime have been blanked out - which appears rather strange. The effect of this censorship is that although the first part of the report is copied from a newspaper, the event still has a slightly unreal feel to it. The writer ends his report by stating that the druggist and his companion were each fined £5.

The tone of this report has a remarkably modern journalistic style to it. It transpires that one member of the regiment was imprisoned, for a military contravention, and his colleagues, who appear to have been mainly private soldiers, disagreed with decision. They then threatened the soldiers on guard duty and mutinied. It did not go their way, however, as the Lord Commander-in-Chief for Scotland surrounded the city and arrested them.

It was common for the court cases of that day, their outcomes and their dramas, to be reported on broadsides as a matter for common interest. Broadsides were amongst some of the most immediate communications of their day. Here, a further five cases are reported, those of Mary Hunter, Donald McLeod, Peter Kerr or Carr, John Runciman and the co-operative theft by Mary Anne Cairns, Thomas Purves and his wife Martha.

Unlike many broadside ballads, this song starts with the chorus rather than verse one. The ballad appears to be dedicated to a young man called Heather Jock, who, judging from various episodes listed by the narrator, seems to have indulged in poaching and a little pilfering. Certainly, the ballad depicts him as a bit of a rogue. However, Heather Jock meets his nemesis in the shape of a stern  judge, who punishes his poaching by sentencing him to transportation to Botany Bay, Australia.

'Swack' in this instance probably means 'nimble' or 'agile'. The chorus reads: 'Heather Jock's noo awa, / Heather Jock's noo awa, / The muircock noo may crously craw, / Since Heather Jock's noo awa.' 'Crously' is Scots for 'proudly' or 'boldly'.
Heather Jock appears to have been quite a character. Although he was apparently transported to Botany Bay for a string of illegal exploits, this ballad remembers Jock rather fondly - immortalising him as a naughty but lovable rogue.

It is unlikely that this 'lamentation' was really written by Peter Gray. Lamentations of the condemned were common topics in broadsides, following a typical formula that involved renouncing sin, repenting and asking for God's and the public's forgiveness. The ghost-writers were probably broadside journalists, or else churchmen who had attended the condemned. The melodramatic title of this example suggests that its author had higher poetic ambitions.

The reporting of court proceedings was a fairly common subject for a broadside. Typically, these would be reported much as they might be in a local newspaper today, as a list of prisoners with the relevant charges. It is significant, however, that far more detail here is devoted to a charge of murder than to any other case: murders were always of great public interest. The Saltmarket area, close to where the Court sat, was Scotland's largest production centre for broadsides, and this one was produced by one of its best known printers, William Carse.

This sheet was published by Robert Martin.
Robert Martin worked in the Edinburgh book and print trade between 1830 and 1850, and it can be assumed that this sheet was published during this period. A gauger was the customs official who was responsible for measuring the liquor capacity of imported barrels so that the tax could be worked out correctly. In 1823 the Duke of Gordon successfully initiated the 'Excise Act' to try and eradicate illegal whisky production, but in 1834 692 illicit stills were recorded in Scotland.

The sheet was published by John Muir of Glasgow, and the story was sourced from 'The Limerick Chronicle'.
This fascinating broadside describes the executions of five 'whiteboys', who were, presumably, sentenced to death for committing various offences under the Whiteboy Act of 1765. A Whiteboy was a member of an organisation first formed in County Tipperary around 1761, for the purpose of redressing grievances. Members of this movement wore white shirts and committed agrarian sabotage during the night. Most of the text focuses on what the men said while on the scaffold and how they conducted themselves.

There is no date attached to the sheet but the narrative reveals that Captain Smith, or Thomas Dickson,  moved to Edinburgh town in 1833 and so his capture and this publication must have occurred after then. This is a good illustration of how broadsides functioned. They were the cheap popular entertainment of their day, and as such dates and places were often not clarified.

This sheet was published by Thomas Duncan of Glasgow.
Thomas Duncan operated in the Saltmarket area of Glasgow between 1800 and 1823. Among his speciality productions were court lists and execution notices. Due to competition in the area, however, he often used information from places further away. The most sensational verdict was that for Anderson and Robertson, who were sentenced to hang for breaking into James Russell's shop.

Although no dates are given for Robert Brown, he did operate a printing house between 1713 and 1733 in the Forrester's Wynd area of Edinburgh. He seems to have produced mainly chapbooks and broadsides, especially on executions. Brown also produced children's books, which were another common sideline in smaller printing houses.

'Stouthrief' is a Scots law term meaning 'theft with violence (later only in a dwelling-house)'. The sheet was published in 1824 by John Muir of Glasgow.
This broadside reports the violent end of a young man called Alexander Milne, who was executed for housebreaking and using force on the houseowner during the robbery. After a brief summary of the crime, the author proceeds to describe the execution, paying great attention to the entourage of religious ministers that accompanied the condemned prisoner to the scaffold. Although, from a modern viewpoint, receiving the death sentence for housebreaking seems terribly harsh, it appears that Aberdeen was suffering numerous break-ins at this time, and had recently executed three men for a similar crime. Therefore, Milne had little hope of earning a reprieve.

The offer of a reward would have most likely roused considerable interest in the escape of Alexander Campbell.

It is easy to imagine this pronouncement pasted on the walls of countless taverns and inns around Edinburgh.

The sheet was published in 1834 and cost one penny.
Although this broadside claims to be a factual report featuring real people, it is most likely a fictional story composed to encourage people to improve their moral conduct. The story tells of how a wicked master, after having his advances rejected by a pretty servant girl, tries to incriminate her as a thief. The day of the girl's execution turns out to be a day of judgement for the master, however, as he is blinded by a bolt of lightning, after refusing to save the girl from the gallows by admitting his guilt.

It probably relates to John Wilson and Duncan Fraser who were executed for robbery in January 1824. The letter is interesting in that it suggests that it was dictated to a minister who had attended the prisoner. Many broadsides of the time contained poems and letters directly attributed to condemned prisoners who were very probably illiterate, and it is often difficult to tell whether the prisoners really had any input.
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers.

This crime report takes the form of a ballad, the first line of which reads: 'O Hope! Thou sweet celestial spring'. A note at the bottom of the sheet states that it was 'Printed for the Book Cryers'.
Unfortunately, it is not clear what specific situation the introductory text and ballad in this broadside refer to. After the grave warning in the introduction regarding the deadly judgement that High Court judges can sometimes pass on errant juvenile behaviour, the ballad takes the audience into the higher realm of the celestial judges. In short, this broadside would appear to be a hybrid of crime report and vehicle for moral instruction - written specifically for a young audience. The powerful religious language and imagery that dominates throughout the ballad, reveals much about the nature of Scottish society during this era.

16041,apparitions,L.C.1269(159a),"Verse 1: 'When night's dark mantle has covered all / I come in fire arrayed; / many a victim I've seen fall, / Or fly from me dismay'd. / Will-o'-the-wisp! they trembling cry, / Will-o'-the -wisp! 'tis he! / To mark their fright as off they fly / Is merry sport for me.' This ballad was to be sung to an 'Original' tune, and was priced at one penny. It was published on Saturday, 1st May 1869 by the Poet's Box, probably in Glasgow.
The subject of this poem is a natural phenomenon that has long been regarded in British folklore as a portentous symbol. Will-o'-the-wisp is the popular name for standing flames that are occasionally seen on boggy ground. These are thought to be caused by the spontaneous ignition of methane gas that has been produced by rotting marsh vegetation. Myth has associated will-'o-the-wisp with the spirits of the dead or with supernatural agents, and stories abound of the peculiar natural lights luring men and women into danger or appearing where death is about to occur.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson. 
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites. The term 'ballad' eventually applied more broadly to any kind of topical or popular verse.",Broadside ballad entitled 'Will-o'-the-Wisp',1869

'The Tragedy of Tony Aston' is based on a real case in Edinburgh, from 1728. Tony, or Tonny,  Aston or Ashton, was a strolling player who came to Edinburgh in the 1720s. He was promoted by the poet Allan Ramsay who wrote prologues for Aston?s performances as well as selling tickets for his plays. In 1726 Aston was denied a licence to perform by the Master of the Revels as he had failed to pay to the Revels office, the dues he owed them. Nevertheless he continued to perform until Skinner?s Hall (where he performed) was shut down. After a spell of litigation, Aston cut his losses and left Edinburgh in 1728.

The sheet was published by William Carse of Glasgow in 1824.
This broadside really does embody the dark concept of gallows humour. Already facing the death sentence for housebreaking and theft, the prisoner, John Wood, had previously received two stays of execution providing him with an extended six weeks of life. Astonishingly, however, Wood is to appear in court to face another housebreaking charge - the day before the date of his execution! To compound the irony of Wood's predicament, it seems highly likely that he will be found innocent of this second charge. Much of the second part of the sheet is taken up with discussion regarding Wood's religious frame of mind, while the last few lines offer sympathy and ask for an investigation into this most peculiar matter.

The first verse of the lamentation reads: Though in a dismal cell we stay, / We think time passes swift away,  / We have not long to mediatate, / Upon our fast-approaching fate.' It was published in Edinburgh by the travelling booksellers in 1824.
The verses here are almost certainly not the work of John Wilson and Duncan Frazer, despite the attribution in the introduction: 'their behaviour has been most examplary and pious, as may be seen from the following effusions'. The verses, in simple rhyming couplets, follow a standard formula for lamentations, describing the misery of the condemned and their prayers and wishes for forgiveness, and warning the reader not to sin and to lead a Christian life. The author is likely to have been an experienced broadside writer.

This broadside was published by Menzies, in Edinburgh.
Written in the usual outraged and indignant tone of crime-related broadsides, this example tells of a couple on the way home from Airdrie who were assaulted in a premeditated attack by six men.The husband was seized by two men masquerading as police constables, and taken towards the jail. Four apparently public-spirited gentlemen then offered to walk the woman home, but instead they assaulted her.

The broadside was published by T. Duncan of 159 Saltmarket, Glasgow.
Broadside reports of executions varied in the details they chose to focus on. In some cases the process of the execution was described in minute details; others, like this, gave a potted biography of the condemned man or woman, and described the circumstances surrounding their crimes. The author of this broadside appears to be quite sympathetic towards Sherry, emphasising his piety, regrets and good manners after his arrest.

Due to the increasing size of cities and the anonymity this brought, a niche was created in the publishing market for public announcements of this nature. The broadside audience was always avid for scandalous news which touched on their lives, unlike politicians or international affairs.

This sheet was published by Forbes and Owen of Edinburgh.
This sheet is an odd conglomerate of stories some of which have been sourced from Irish and English papers. The Gilmerton murder, when Margaret Paterson was assaulted and murdered by two carters, is mentioned. The Norfolk case involved the Dublin-born prize fighter Simon Byrne being prosecuted for the death of his opponent. This fight took place at Salcey Green, Northamptonshire in June 1830. Byrne had previously defeated M'Kay in the ring. After being tried, he was acquitted for the Scot's death. In 1831 he was deafeated in a contest for the championship of England against Jem Ward. Byrne died in 1833 at St. Albans after a fight with James 'Deaf' Burke. The other account appears to be an Irish story about parents suffocating their daughter after she contracted rabies.

Priced at one penny, this is another broadsheet that begins in prose, but then transposes into verse. A crime report, it tells of the stay of execution granted to a William Grieve, who was sentenced to death for rape. However, the emergence of fresh evidence meant that the execution in Edinburgh scheduled for the 3rd of April 1833 was postponed, while the new facts were considered.

The sheet was published in 1825 by William Carse of Glasgow.
This broadside describes the unleashing of a new form of punishment for criminals who were convicted of violent offences: the dreaded 'cat o' nine tails'. Before describing the administering of this sentence, the author stresses that whipping has been introduced to make the streets safer for the public. With the prisoner, John Kean, standing on the execution scaffold, he received between 80-90 lashes on his bare back before being carried away to prison. As the judge felt that Kean's attempt to murder a man deserved more than a whipping, the prisoner was then transported for life. The sheet concludes with a chilling warning to others regarding their future conduct - thus highlighting the social control element of broadsides.

The penalties for such crimes were often severe and could, at times, extend to execution. With the sheer numbers passing through the courts, it appears that many criminals were not deterred by the prospect of the death penalty.

The sheet was published in Glasgow by John Muir.
Although these people were sentenced to death, in actual fact none were executed. Most had their sentences commuted to prison terms and ten were transported for life. These handloom weavers were desperate, and attacked the mechanised looms that were destroying their livelihood. The judge recognises their plight, saying 'There has been, God knows, a great pressure of distress in this country, but it cannot be permitted to individuals to carve their own relief'.

It is impossible to say whether James Campbell did in fact recite this prayer. In a highly religious and moralistic society such as nineteenth-century Scotland, the sentiments contained in this prayer would have provoked a very positive reaction. Broadside producers took advantage of this and, in the hope of selling large numbers of sheets, printed highly formulaic last speeches and prayers that were full of repentence and religious enlightenment.

A note at the bottom of the sheet states that it was printed in Edinburgh, 'for the Booksellers', and cost a penny.
No-one seen by the court was awarded the death penalty. Almost all were banished or sentenced to 7 or 14 years' transportation. At this time, they would most likely have been sent to either Australia or the West Indies. It is interesting to note how much emphasis is put on the accused people's reputations. Such anecdotal evidence would be given no legal credibility in a court today.
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers.

The first begins: 'A strange and comical account of Three Gentlemen who left Edinburgh, and sailed in the ECLIPSE Steam Packet for Belfast, and having large sums of money in their possession, they proposed to sleep in one room; when scarcely asleep one of them imagined he saw a man . . .' The report is not dated, but its original source is given as 'yesterday's ""Edinburgh Star.""'  Also included is an account of a 'DREADFUL RIOT' taken from 'a Belfast Paper'.
The larger of the two reports here is a tale of a traveller who raised the alarm thinking he was being robbed, and was then mistaken for the robber by his companions. The second is more interesting hstorically. It describes a fight at Maghera, Northern Ireland, between Orangemen and Ribbandmen. Ribbandmen, or Ribbonmen, were members of an Irish secret society that grew up in the late eighteenth century in opposition to the Protestant Orange orders. The name came from a green ribbon worn by members. The society was declared illegal in 1871, and this broadside probably predates that.

It was published by A McMillan in the Lawnmarket, Edinburgh.
Transportation was the punishment of sending convicts to serve their sentences in overseas territories. It was introduced in the late seventeenth century, when most convicts were sent to the Britain's American colonies. After the American war of independence, Australia became the principal destination of the convict ships. Swan River, which is mentioned in this broadside, was a penal colony in Western Australia, and was the last area in Australia to accept transportees. The final convict transport left Scotland in 1867.

The apparition is said to have been four headless men carrying a coffin, accompanied by a fifth headless man on horseback. It was apparently seen by  several sentinels posted near the late Duke of Buckingham's house in London. It is worth noting that this broadside appeared at a time when women were still being burned at the stake for practising witchcraft. In a country where fear and suspicion of the unknown led to these barbaric practices, it is hardly surprising that reports of apparitions and supernatural occurrences had a strange appeal amongst a highly superstitious populace.

Printed by Forbes & Co., Edinburgh.
This broadside is a straightforward list containing the names of the prisoners, plus the crimes they are accused of, who are due to appear in trials at the High Court. Glancing down this list and timetable, there is certainly a wide selection of crimes, ranging from homicide to fugitation - which means to abscond from justice.Theft is the offence that appears most frequently.

The ballad itself begins: 'Plung'd in black Darkness and Eternal Night, / For Crimes committed 'gainst Almighty Light'. Unfortunately, no publication details are included on the sheet.
Often sounding like a fire and brimstone sermon from a zealous preacher, this broadside is a warning to criminals to start behaving themselves and thinking of their eternal souls. Written from the viewpoint of a lost soul who now lives a hellish existence on 'the other side', he warns sinners that they must repent now, since repentance after death is too late to save their souls. In an age when religion was one of the main tools of social control, this broadside tells us much about how powerful religion used to be in Scottish society. Writing this warning from the perspective of a ghost lends a supernatural element to the broadside, and stops it from sounding too much like a sermon.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

During March and April 1719, it appears there were 'Great Lightnings' in the skies over Europe. This report gives the dates, times and locations of such 'apparitions', and vivid descriptions. The ocurrence in Glasgow seems to have been particularly spectacular, there was 'a Light of several Coulers, and immediately thereafter, there appeared as it were a large Flaming Sword'.

Unfortunately, but not unusually, the publisher's name has not been included on this broadside.
It is possible the spectacle viewed by Moor was in fact the northern lights (aurora borealis). He begins by describing it as a broad rainbow in the sky, only to conclude that it appeared as 'two Armies fighting and attacking, retiring and advancing alternatively very often'. In a highly superstitious age, natural phenomena such as lightning, hailstones and the northern lights were often regarded with suspicion and mistaken for supernatural occurrences.

'Beware the Ides of March!' could be the headline for this light-hearted broadside. The story centres on the idea that the concept of common sense could be murdered by a man in Edinburgh called James Scoogy. It appears that Scoogy was making his way home late one night, when he bumped into the spirit of common sense. The ghost then takes over the narrative from the writer, and laments that he was killed by James Scoogy of the Canongate. After the ghost of common sense has finished telling his supernatural tale, he disappears back into the night. With the writer now back in control of the narrative, he concludes by expressing his hopes that the murderer will soon be brought to justice.

The account details two ghost sightings in Edinburgh, both of which occurred within the space of a week: one in Stevenlaw's Close and the other at 166 High Street. The first sighting appears to have been witnessed by a group of around 500 hundred people, whilst the spectre at 166 High Street was viewed by a solitary maid-servant.

A note under the title informed readers that this popular song could be purchased from the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee. It was printed by W. Shepherd.
The ghost of Benjamin Binns makes regular visits to the land of the living from his 'home down below'. Horrified to find his wife has taken another husband, Benjamin decides to speak to them both in 'sepulchral tones'. He also wittily recounts his paid visits to the Spiritualist's midnight séance.
Throughout the nineteenth century people were fascinated by the subject of death and the prospect of life after death. The interest largely came from advances in medical science and scientific reasoning, and the questioning of religious doctrines. For many, Spiritualism provided the evidence they required to believe that life continued after death. Interest in the supernatural reached such heights that even songs such as this, which poked fun at the notion, sold extremely well.",Broadside ballad entitled 'The Ghost of Benjamin Binns',1880-1900

This broadside was published in Edinburgh by James Ross. A handwritten note at the top reads: 'This was made on Mrs McLeod who was hanged & falsly said to appear aga[in?]'. The date '1727' has also been added to the bottom of the sheet.
The decorative woodcut printed at the top of this sheet would have added to the broadside's appeal and, along with the popularity of the subject matter, most likely assured healthy sales. If the handwritten note is to be accepted, the apparition of the title was a Mrs McLeod who was hanged in 1727. The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection includes a number of broadsides detailing the case of Mrs McLeod who was executed for forgery in 1727. It is very possibly the same Mrs McLeod that is referred to here.

It was published in Edinburgh by J. Morren, possibly in 1801.
It appears that the noises, which apparently could be heard up to a quarter of a mile away, were investigated by several people, including a number of clergymen. With the suggestion that the disturbance could be supernatural, it is stressed that those involved were 'serious Christians'. Reports of unusual events, including apparitions, noises and strange lights in the sky proved popular reading with the public. There was a fascination, as there is today, with 'the unexplained'.

Still disguised as a man Murphy then proposed marriage to her landlady, Water Jenny, in order to procure her savings.

This broadside was printed by R. Reynolds, 489 Lawnmarket, Edinburgh.
According to this account, Catherine Wilson assumed the name of John Thomson during her time disguised as a man. The creation of an alter ego was apparently in response to losing her parents at the age of six or seven. Whilst this story was most probably considered a curiosity and provided entertaining reading at the time, for today's audience it highlights the plight of women during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In a society where women's civil, legal and political rights were almost non-existent, Catherine Wilson was forced to live as a man to earn her living and, as a lone woman, ensure her safety.

In 1826, William Pollock was found guilty of murdering his wife and sentenced to be hanged. Throughout the entire ordeal, Pollock vehemently protested his innocence and, finally, seeing no way out of his situation, chose to commit suicide two days before his execution. This case must have sparked a lot of interest, as many broadsides were issued detailing the facts of the case and Pollock's suicide. A large number of these broadsides can now be found in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

Broadside reports of suicides were often used by authors or editors as an opportunity for moralising, and it was not uncommon for the reports to include lengthy 'suicide notes' which were in fact more likely the work of the broadside's author.

This broadside in fact contains two murder reports. This would have offered people value for their penny (the price of a broadside), since most crime sheets merely offered coverage of one incident. The second report details a double murder near Barnet, England. The bodies of an elderly woman (60) and her daughter (39) were found 'completely saturated with blood' by a servant.

When King James VII of Scotland and II of England was deposed in 1689, the Presbyterian church was relieved to have the Catholic king removed. Although King William of Orange (r. 1689-1702) restored Presbyterianism as the Established Church in Scotland in 1690, a section of its fold, followers of Richard Cameron (d.1680), were not happy that the 1638 Covenant had not also been restored. They left to form the Reformed Presbyterian Church, still sometimes referred to today as the Cameronian Church. This satirical broadside anticipates that move.
The National Library of Scotland's online catalogue attributes this piece to Alexander Pennecuik (1652-1722). Known as the 'burgess bard', he had a prolific output in the late seventeenth and early nineteenth centuries.",Broadside entitled 'To His Highness the Prince of Orange',1689

August instant for the Robbing of the Prince Regent Coach, between Edinburgh and Glasgow, on the 24th. of March 1831.' This sheet was published by George Craig of Edinburgh. A 'lamentation' was an act of expressing grief, regret and perhaps atonement.
After a brief introduction, this broadside ballad dramatically tells the woeful tale of one George Giechrist, who was sentenced to death for robbing the Prince Regent Coach. The verses tell of a robber seeking redemption, and the tone of this piece reads very much like a last confession to a priest. The difference is, however, that this broadside would have been read by numerous people, since crime broadsides were very popular with the public. As with many other broadsides, therefore, it ends up reading like a hybrid of last confession and a stern warning to others to stick to the path of righteousness.

The National Library of Scotland's catalogue attributes this verse to Alexander Pennecuik (1652-1722), a prolific author of humorous and satirical broadsides in the early part of the eighteenth century. The piece is a very tongue-in-cheek plea to the king, on behalf of the people of Linton, which is a village in Teviotdale, in the Scottish Borders.

Grierson, and James M'Ewan, 3 boys, the oldest only 15 years of age, and all belonging to Edinburgh, for house-breaking and robbery, in Gray Street and George's Square, and who are to be Executed in Edinburgh, on the 12th of Feb. next.' This sheet was published by Glass of Edinburgh.
These three boys were found guilty of housebreaking and stealing a vast quantity of silver and silk - the daring of youth. No details are given of their arrest and conviction, but their previous offences are emphasised. Legal code at this time gave prime protection to people's property and so their list of stolen goods coupled with their reputations went against them. This case was reported on other broadsides held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

On Saturday the 18th October, probably during the 1820s, the Stirling-Edinburgh mail coach was robbed whilst it stopped at Kirkliston. Three men took £10,000 cash from the boot while the staff were engaged on business. This sort of story, with its detailed description of the strategy, its seedier allusions (to the brothel for example) and the arrest of witnesses and accomplices, would have made compulsive reading. Audience were looking to be entertained especially as the growth of city populations meant that local gossip was harder to diffuse.

15582,pirates,Ry.III.c.36(014),"This crime report begins: 'We have the following Account of a horrid Murder committed by Pirates on the Coast of Ireland, and how they threw the Crew over board.' Four pirates, three named John Eustace or Philip Roch, Richard Neale and Francis Wise, seized a French vessel, mastered by Peter Tartoue, on the voyage from Cork, Ireland to Nantes, France.
The waters around Ireland were notorious for piracy during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Ireland reared the most famous pirate of them all 'Blackbeard', who was actually born Sean McDermott in 1656. It is now believed that, during this period, roughly 87% of Irish boys were involved in piratical activities by the age of seven. Two of the men, Richard Neale and Francis Wise, had returned to Ireland before they were arrested, suggesting Irish connections. John Eustace or Philip Roch, however, is mentioned as having received a letter from his wife, suggesting that they lived, geographically, apart.

It was published by James McLean of Edinburgh.
The case described here is that of three boys aged between thirteen and seventeen, who have been sentenced to death for housebreaking and theft. Often broadside authors and editors were supportive of the harsh sentences handed down in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Scotland, but here a letter arguing against the death sentences is reproduced, and the editorial agrees with its plea for clemency. The letter draws attention to the backgrounds of the condemned boys, proving that the association between crime and social deprivation is not merely a modern liberal theory. The execution of under-16s in Britain was not abolished until 1908.

This sheet would have sold for a penny at the time of publication.
The term battery here, seems to refer to a brothel or house of ill-repute, the 'soldiers' and 'weapons' inside being the inhabitants. This story relates how an innocent and naïve young man is enticed into carousing and then staying the night with the women of the house, who eventually pick his pockets as he sleeps. The outcome of the story is that he loses his horse, his reputation and contracts a venereal disease.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative. Broadside authors tended to see themselves as moral guardians and teachers in society. As such, publishers often disseminated 'educational' texts outlining the social and personal consequences of undisciplined or immoral behaviour.",Broadside regarding a young farmer's adventures with a dandy young lady,1830-

Luckie Spence was a famous Edinburgh brothel keeper. The satire written on her death, 'Lucky Spence's Last Advice', is also in the National Library of Scotland's collection. This piece is more sombre in tone. It is written in the person of Lucky's 'girls', as they bemoan the fact that she will certainly go to hell, and remember the good times they had working for her.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites. The term 'ballad' eventually applied more broadly to any kind of topical or popular verse.",Broadside entitled 'The Whores of Edinburgh's Lament for want of Luckie Spence',1718

Moral instruction was common feature of broadsides. In this example the report is written from the point of view of a dying prostitute.  Although it is stressed that she was 'well educated' it is unlikely that the prostitute was the author of the piece. It is possible that an anonymous author wrote it after encountering and interviewing a dying prostitute. It is also possible that the prostitute is a figment of the author's imagination, a symbol warning women of the dangers of prostitution. The language used in the report suggests that the author was someone with strong religious beliefs or connections.

The sheet was published by William Carse of Glasgow.
This highly erudite broadside introduces the audience to Edinburgh's very own Nostradamus: John Leckie of Cramond. Before dying in 1820 at the ripe old age of 105, it seems that Leckie made a series of prophecies regarding what would befall Scotland, England and Ireland in the near future. As with Nostradamus, however, these visions are stated in a rather opaque style of language, meaning that Leckie's predictions can be interpreted in numerous different ways. For instance, he states that Scotland, once famed for its enlightened citizens, is about to enter a period of darkness, from which, after a short time, it will emerge into a new period of enlightenment. However, such visions would have pleased and entertained the audience.

During the period of unrest surrounding Charles I's arrest and execution, Pontefract Castle remained staunchly loyal to the royalist cause and so was besieged for about a year. Setting this text within the context of Pontefract Castle would have given the piece royalist connotations. The text then goes on to 'prophesise' the actual history of the Protectorate and reassure the readers that the monarchy will triumph yet again.

'Martin', the supposed author of this broadside, is not identified anywhere in the text beyond being established as a shadowy individual who has travelled widely and lived through many conflicts and historical changes. The document does not seem to be a satire so much as a piece of reformer's polemic. The text criticises a 'recent campaign', probably the Napoleonic wars, for helping to restore old regimes, and prophecises that England will lose its domination of world trade to the United States, that Scotland will suffer a temporary economic downturn, and that in Ireland, poverty and political and religious division will soon be at an end.

Predictions for the coming year by astrologers or mystics, are today an integral and profitable part of the book and newspaper trade. In 1830 or 1831, when this broadside is likely to have been published, this was probably a slightly more unusual feature, although astrology and fortune-telling were ancient practices in their own rights. In retrospect, few of this prophet's predictions for 1831 appear to have been accurate, although the death of Ex-US president James Monroe on July 4th could be seen as fulfilling the prophecy of a 'great statesman' meeting 'death or disgrace'. Then, as now, the key to public prophecy appears to have been to remain quite non-specific.

The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection includes numerous reports and accounts written during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792-1815).

A large number of the broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection chart the political and religious tensions that existed in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain. In particular, there are numerous accounts detailing the political wranglings between the Tory and Whig parties. In this mock lamentation, the Whigs announce 'We preach the things we do not practise, / The guilded Bait that dims our Eyes, / Is Pride and Self'!
Whig was first used as an abusive term to describe those who opposed the religious reforms of King Charles II, and by 1679 was the name given to those who opposed the succession of James II - a staunch Catholic. In political life it became synonymous with those who advocated parliamentary power over the crown, also known as liberals or radicals, as opposed to the Torys who believed in the supreme power of the crown.","Broadside entitled 'The Cardinal's Coach Couped, or the Whigs Lamentation for the Episcopal Toleration'",1711

David Dobie and John Thomson were sentenced to execution and dissection  for the robbery, rape and murder of Margaret Paterson of Gilmerton.

The most common punishment meted on these two days of cases was transportation, but some convicts were instead sentenced to imprisonment in Glasgow Bridewell. Bridewells were prisons modelled on the 'house of correction', originally founded to house the homeless, at Bridewell Palace in London in 1550.

Broadsides summarising court proceedings were fairly common, just as sheriff court cases for minor crimes might be summarised in local newspapers today. The obvious difference between then and now is the severity of the sentences that were handed down in 1823.

Stewart and Wright had poisoned Lamont, with intent to rob him, by putting laudanum, a tincture made from opium, into his drink.

It appears that after carrying out the robbery, the villains went out to celebrate and, rather bizarrely, the leader of the gang, Robert Johnston, entrusted an acquaintance to look after the stolen money. It was this rash act that ultimately led to their undoing. Johnston was sentenced to death, and his two accomplices were banished.

This broadside describes the trials and sentences of two separate crimes. The first report tells of a defendant called William Mitchel, who was found guilty of forgery and sentenced to death. It could be that this sentence was reduced to one of transportation, however, since many death sentences for crimes such as forgery were later reduced if the jury recommended mercy. Following this report, is a chilling account of how Samuel Tucker, a weaver turned doctor, starved his wife to death after imprisoning her in their house. Tucker was sentenced to death for this most horrendous of crimes and, after confessing his sins in a chapel, was executed in Salisbury.

Other broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection reveal that there was outcry at this 1823 death sentence, for housebreaking and theft, passed on three boys aged between thirteen and seventeen. A respite of one month was subsequently granted to them, and at the bottom of this broadside, a later handwritten annotation states: 'Pardoned and sent to Botany Bay', suggesting that the sentences against all three were eventually commuted to transportation to Australia. The death sentence for under-16s in Britain was not abolished until 1908.

The process of hanging was universal in Great Britain until 1850, when more scientific and 'humane' ways were introduced. Prisoners were hung by the 'short fall' method. This is when the prisoners' support is removed from under them. Bodies were usually left hanging for at least an hour to ensure they were dead. The Grassmarket area was most commonly used for Edinburgh executions.

The broadside was published by John Campbell of Edinburgh. The date is not supplied.
The cases on this broadside illustrate some of the differences between attitudes to crime today and in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Had William Hardie killed his victim, he would almost certainly have hanged, but as it was he was sentenced to only four months for attempted murder: crimes of violence, provided they did not result in death, were often regarded as quite inconsequential. Today Hardie could not have been hanged, but his sentence for a premeditated shooting would have been far longer than four months. The death penalty for housebreaking and theft was not fully abolished until 1861, probably subsequent to the publication of this broadside, and Robert Horn, as a 'notorious' thief, was quite lucky to escape with transportation.

Donald Rankine had already been convicted of robbery but here it is reported that there was an error in recording the date of the verdict and where he should be tried and punished.

According to this account, Sime broke into four different houses in Edinburgh and stole from each a number of items of clothing. Although the jury found him guilty of housebreaking and theft, they recommended him to mercy. This request was disregarded by the judge, however, and Sime was sentenced to be executed. However shocking it is to a modern-day audience, execution was the chosen punishment for many apparently petty crimes in nineteenth-century Scotland.

Also included in the National Library of Scotland's collection is a broadside featuring Peter Henderson's lamentation, in which he expresses deep regret for his crime. This particular broadside, however, details Henderson's trial and offers an interesting insight into crime and punishment in early nineteenth-century Scotland.

This sheet was published by James McLean, in Edinburgh, and would have cost a penny to buy.
James Campbell was convicted of robbery and murder, after having mugged and struck John Horner in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh. Campbell asserted that he was unaware of the assault but had robbed Horner of personal effects, in the hope that a lenient sentence would be passed. The judges, however, felt that daylight robbery was an aggravated offence and no witnesses could be produced to attest his social behaviour. In common with other reports of the time, the judge's comments on repentance and making peace with God were reported, as was the prisoners grief. This sort of moralising would have reached a wide audience due to the public way in which broadsides were read.

The structure of broadside trial reports can vary quite considerably. In this example, the evidence given by the various witnesses is transcribed in the first person with very little additional editorial comment, so that the report reads almost like a play script. The report gives us an interesting cross-section of Glasgow society when Glasgow was a modest-sized town. It seems that various witnesses, like the Jewish jeweller Moses Solomon, Stewart the shopman, and even Laidlaw the defendant, were already quite familiar with each other.

This satire appears to be a criticism of Scotland's docility in allowing her self-seeking politicians to agree to the Union of 1707. To understand the satire, the reader has to decode the central symbol of the satire: 'the Albanian Animal'. As Alba is the Gaelic name for Scotland, the adjective 'Albanian' means Scottish - so the phrase translates as 'the Scottish Animal'. It could be, however, that even in the eighteenth-century, the country of Albania embodied connotations of backwardness and ignorance. Classically erudite in tone and style, the satire closes with a spectacular - though foreboding - image of 'the Albanian Animal' jumping from the 'Gallow-tree'.

A note at the foot of this sheet states that it was 'Reprinted from the Dublin Copy'.
This poem was written in 1724 by the Dean of Saint Patrick's, better known as Jonathan Swift. Writing under the pseudonym of M.B. Drapier, Swift's poem is an attack on the British government's decision to award a contract to the Englishman, William Wood, to mint some copper halfpennies for use in Ireland - hence the list of forge-related occupations in the poem's title. It was obvious that Wood had bribed the British government to receive this contract, and there was also a fear that these new coins would destroy the monetary system in Ireland. Swift's 'Drapier Letters' are considered important because he argues the point that Ireland should control its own affairs.

The 'Second Defence' seen here was written in response to Defoe's 'Reply'. All three were written in 1706, the year before the union of the Scottish and English parliaments. Defoe, who spent the early years of the eighteenth century in Scotland, was a great supporter of the union and did much to promote it. As can be seen by this rebuttal, however, his efforts were often treated with contempt by the Scottish people.

Francis Jeffrey (1773-1850) a lawyer by vocation, was also an active Whig politician, socialite and and founder of the 'Edinburgh Review', a hugely successful quarterly magazine. Jeffrey was the manager of the Parliamentary Reform Bill for Scotland, and this ballad praises his support for the Bill and urges its audience to vote for Jeffrey in the forthcoming General Election. Jeffrey was returned as Member of Parliament for Edinburgh in December 1832, six months after the Reform Bill was passed. Without the passing of the Bill, many of Jeffrey's supporters may not have been entitled to vote.

A note below the title states that it should be sung to the tune of 'The Arethusa', which is a traditional Scottish song dating from around 1730. The sheet was published by Waugh of Edinburgh, and the date of publication was probably around 1833.
This celebratory broadside has a satirical companion in another political sheet entitled, 'Huzza! for Provost Spittal!!!', which is also included in the National Library of Scotland's collection. Jamie Aytoun (1797-1881) and Sir James Spittal (1769-1842) were rival candidates for the position of Lord Provost of Edinburgh. Aytoun never succeeded in his fight, but Spittal was Provost from 1833-37. Spittal Street, located in the Tollcross area of the city, was named in tribute to him.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing.

This broadside, ostensibly posing as a historical report, is in fact anti-English propaganda against the proposed Act of Union between the Scots and English parliaments. This was eventually passed in 1707. Daniel Defoe and John Hamilton, Baron Belhaven, were especially vocal, Defoe on the unionist side. The National Library of Scotland holds their broadside publications.
This tactic of using the story of Wallace and his fight against the English to highlight current injustices was employed again in recent years. The emotive influence of the film 'Braveheart' (1995), which included this speech Wallace made in 1298 at the Battle of Falkirk, was exploited by the Scottish National Party.

The sheet was published by L. MacArtney of the Poet's Box, 184 Overgate, Dundee.
This sheet begins as a public notice but quickly turns into a list of veiled political comments, mainly about Communists, the French and the Suez Canal. The Poet's Box in Dundee was a prolific ballad publisher but this sheet illustrates the more serious side of their business. It also suggests the level of political awareness and interest prevalent in Scotland's towns. This style of text, with its implicit political propaganda, would not only have made for compelling entertainment, but would also perhaps have stimulated political thought, reasoning and debate.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

This ballad appears to be a satirical critique of a politician called Sir John Dudley, who is hoping that Edinburgh will provide him with a safe parliamentary seat. The writer's references to 'Brougham and Grey' suggest that the ballad was written some time during the 1830s, as Henry Brougham (1778-1868) served in Earl Grey's (1764-1845) Whig government during this era. The writer spotlights Dudley's protean talent for transforming his politics from Whig to Radical, depending on whatever it takes to be elected. This is why the writer warns Edinburgh not to be beguiled by his French tricolour banner, which is merely a flag of political convenience.

The English-born novelist, secret servant and novelist Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) was highly vocal in his support for the Act of Union (1707) between the English and Scottish parliaments, and wrote many pamphlets on the subject. This piece, written in a sarcastic tone of mock admiration, has been attributed to Baron Belhaven, John Hamilton (1656-1708). It was probably written around 1706.

It was to be sung to the tune 'Auld Rob Morris'. The broadside does not carry the name of its publisher, nor the place or date of publication.
The ballad on this broadside is structured as a dialogue between 'Bobby J_____n' and 'Auld Reekie', and its subject is James Aytoun (1797-1881) of Kirkcaldy, who was a Radical candidate for Stirling in the 1841 General Election. Auld Reekie is a nickname for the city of Edinburgh, and the verses spoken by 'Auld Reekie', which are highly critical of Aytoun's politics and his looks, are probably meant to represent the majority opinion in Edinburgh. Aytoun was ultimately unsuccessful in his campaign.

There are many political broadsides contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

This light-hearted broadside offers readers an entertaining A-Z guide of prospective candidates who stood for election in Edinburgh during the 1830s. Given the writer's obvious sympathies for the candidate, Jamie Aytoun, (1797-1881) it seems likely that the broadside was written from the viewpoint of the Radical Party. The writer succeeds in making entries for the awkward alphabetical letters, V, X and Z, by poking fun at rival candidates and even the voters themselves.

This ballad refers to the downfall of Sir James Spittal, who was Provost of Edinburgh from 1833-37. Aytoun (1797-1881) never succeeded in his fight to become Provost. The writer's emphasis on ridiculing Spittal because he worked as a silk merchant reveals much about the writer's - and society's - prejudices. For as the nouveau riche acquired more power and influence in early nineteenth century society, they were frequently attacked for trying to take over the running of the country.

Owen's enduring fame is due to his socialist legacy of his village of New Lanark, Scotland. Here working hours were cut, good housing was provided and the importance of education and recreation was stressed to the community. Although never taken particularly seriously, Owen enjoyed the friendship and patronage of a wide base of royalty, reformers, statesmen, politicians and activists.",Broadside entitled 'Downfall of Socialism!

James Aytoun (1797-1881) of Kirkcaldy, a manufacturer, stood as a Radical candidate for Stirling during the 1841 General Election. The satirical ballad on this broadside implies that Aytoun's Radicalism was a fraud, and that he was at heart a Conservative who would eventually return to his Conservative roots. As evidence for this, the ballad suggests that Aytoun was one of those who helped suppress the 1820 'Radical War', specifically in Bonnymuir, where members of a band at a political march were arrested.

The broadside carries no publication details.
The story on this broadside, which describes the ghost of a murdered French Revolutionary appearing at a radical meeting in Shotts, appears to have been intended as a parable warning against political agitation in Scotland.  The ghost of 'Rochefoucault' appears to be an inaccurate representation of the Duke de la Rochfoucauld-Liancourt (1747-1827), a democratic reformer who nevertheless remained loyal to Louis XVI and who was not murdered. This inaccuracy may have been due to falsified or confused reporting at the time of the Revolution.

Signed with the initials, 'W.G.', the public address on the sheet praises the 'independent spirit' of Edinburgh's menfolk, while urging them to read 'the Edinburgh Review'. The ballad is called 'Francis Jeffrey' and begins: 'OH! JEFFREY! welcome to your town / She prays an' greets you as a boon'. A note below the song's title states that it should be sung to the tune of 'Johnny Cope'. Although no publication details are included on the sheet, the subject matter suggests that it was probably published around the mid-1830s.
The ballad contained in this broadside is dedicated to Francis Jeffrey (1773-1850), who founded 'The Edinburgh Review' in 1802, and edited the publication from 1803 until 1829. Nicknamed 'The Blue and the Yellow' in honour of the Whig Party, 'The Edinburgh Review' was a highly influential publication and set the standard for other literary periodicals. Indeed, Jeffrey's Edinburgh flat, at 18 Buccleuch Place, was a hive of literary activity. When the Whigs were returned to power, Jeffrey was appointed Lord Advocate in 1830 (hence the public address from him), then was elected as MP for Edinburgh in 1832, finally becoming Lord Jeffrey in 1834.

This broadside refers to an incident that happened in Bulgaria, probably during the 1870s, involving the brutal murder of four Catholic clergymen. This was a hot political issue throughout Europe - the Bulgarian struggle against their Turkish overlords attracted sympathy. Tales of Turkish atrocities got the 'Great Powers' embroiled in the region. Whilst broadsides generally reported on events that occurred a lot closer to home, the story of the four Catholics murdered in Bulgaria must have sparked interest. The international nature of this broadside would have made it compelling and unusual reading.

Although the identities of the protagonists remain anonymous, the questions themselves reveal much about what may have been important to the electorate during this era - especially the questions regarding religion. Although it appears to be a straightforward interview session, there are some points which hint at a satirical and slightly subversive tone on the writer's part.

The tune to this song also goes by the name, 'Washing Day', and was originally made popular by Allan Ramsay of Ayr as a whisky toast. (The tune was probably written by Jean Adams and has also been attributed to William Mickle in the 18th century). John Booth is thought to have worked in Aberdeen mainly as a newspaper journalist, between 1806 and 1826. There were periods, however, where he worked for himself, and certainly the topic of this piece would have appealed to a contemporary journalist. Here, comments are being passed, and aspersions cast, on the city's councillors and burgessmen.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

Written in the question and answer format of a catechism, this highly erudite sheet is a character assassination of a man who hoped to succeed Lord Francis Jeffrey (1773-1850) as MP for Edinburgh. Unfortunately, however, the proper name of this electoral candidate is not named, as the author merely refers to him throughout as 'Jack the Coachmaker'. No doubt this nickname would have identified him to people living at the time, thus highlighting the ephemeral nature of broadsides. The author ridicules 'Jack' for previously portraying himself as a Whig and Reformer, only to switch to the Tory Party if it improved his chances of being elected. The 'Poet of Liberty' referred to is Lord Byron (1788-1824).

The letter is signed with the pseudonym Tom Curious. Below it is a reply from a man calling himself 'A true Modern WHIG'. It was published around 1746.
The response is shocking and inflammatory. It is almost certainly a spoof, intended to highlight the national corruption at the time of the Battle of Culloden. The Whig believes that all Jacobites should be killed, including their women who are 'not past the Age of Breeding'. He goes on to say that the livestock and crops should have been seized, the aim being to 'starve those rebellious Wretches in a Year or two'.

Intimidation and bribery of voters were serious concerns at the time of local and national elections in Britain until at least 1872, when a secret ballot was introduced as part of the voting process. This broadside reproduces an alleged attempt by a young woman of Tory sympathies, to intimidate an Edinburgh merchant into voting for Lord Ramsay and Mr Learmonth. John Learmonth was a prominent merchant, owner of the Dean Estate and Lord Provost of Edinburgh at the start of the 1830s. 'Lord Ramsay' may be a reference to George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie (1770-1838). An interesting aspect of this report is the active, almost aggressive political role taken by the woman, despite the fact women had no voting rights at the time.

The song refers to the battle for the position of Edinburgh's Lord Provost, between James Aytoun (1797-1881) and Sir James Spittal, (1769-1842) a silk merchant, which took place during 1833. Spittal won and was Lord Provost from 1833 to 1837. Aytoun never succeeded. This broadside must have been quite popular, as the National Library of Scotland's collection holds further sheets which are exactly the same but for the top which carries the imprint 'Second Edition'.

It was published by the hawkers in Edinburgh. It does not carry a publication date.
The report on this broadside describes a public meeting convened to raise support for Lord Francis Jeffery's campaign to become Whig Member of Parliament for Edinburgh. This suggests that the broadside dates from 1832, when Jeffrey was returned as Edinburgh's MP. Previously he had represented Perth. Jeffery (1773-1850) was by vocation a lawyer but is perhaps better known for being the co-founder (with Henry Brougham) of the 'Edinburgh Review', a hugely influential quarterly magazine which ran from 1802 until 1929. Jeffrey's justified reputation as a ruthless editor and critic brought him into conflict with some of the leading authors of the day.

This satirical broadside is a darkly amusing critique of the failure of the Whig Party to fulfil their election promises. The bitterly disillusioned writer gives free rein to his wild imagination, as he envisages local members of the Whig Party, led by the wonderfully named Sir Turnabout Topboots, standing on the scaffold, prior to their execution. Judging by other political broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection, it seems that the Edinburgh public became disheartened by the Whig Party's failure to implement the reforms they had promised in their election manifesto.

After studying at Winchester and King's College, Cambridge he was returned as Northumberland's M.P. in 1784, and so was launched into the political limelight. He strongly opposed the Tory leader William Pitt for most of his career and was the leading advocate of the 1832 Reform Act passed during his time as Prime Minister (1830-4).

This poem is referring to James Hamilton or Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton (1658-1712), who succeeded to the title after his mother, Ann, Duchess of Hamilton, stood down in 1698. He is best remembered for his opposition to the union of the parliaments and for representing the Jacobites in the Scottish Parliament.

The English-born writer Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) is known to have written 'A Reply to the Scots Answer to the British Vision', which was published in Edinburgh in 1706 - the year before the union of the parliaments. Defoe was sent to Scotland on government business in the early 1700s, and found to his dismay that a large number of Scots failed to understand the move towards unification. Whether this was a warranted view or a rather patronising one, Defoe did devote a large amount of time to understanding Scottish politics and culture. In 1706, after a brief period of absence, Defoe returned to Scotland and set up an Edinburgh-based newspaper entitled 'Postman13'. The paper was pro-unification and aimed to shed some light on the subject. Strangely, perhaps, there is no mention of Defoe on this particular broadside.

This broadside appears to have been printed on behalf of the Earl of Haddington and the Duke of Buccleuch, in reaction to an earlier notice that stated that these noblemen had opposed the passing of the Reform Bill. The notice shown here points out that the men did not oppose the Bill in principle, but rather opposed the disproportionately small parliamentary representation it granted Scotland. The broadside accuses the previous notice of being a deliberate attempt to prejudice the newly expanded electorate against the 'highly talented young candidate', who was probably Lord John Douglas Scott (1809-1860).
The Parliamentary Reform Bill of 1832 increased the number of Scottish MPs from 45 to 53, and extended the vote in the burghs to households with an annual value of £10. This enlarged the voting base in Britain from 6 per cent of the population to 12 per cent, and inevitably led to competition between politicians and parties to win the support of the new voters.

The sheet was published by Chalmers, Ray & Co. The place of publication is not printed on the sheet, but a later handwritten annotation beneath the publisher's name reads: '(Dundee)'. There is no date supplied.
This is an imagined interview between 'John Bull', representing the voice of British reason, and Napoleon Bonaparte, the French Army General and, eventually, emperor of France. Although the broadside is not dated, its references to the career of Bonaparte confirm that it was certainly published after March 1799, when Bonaparte ordered the massacre of more than 4000 prisoners at Jaffa in Syria. The interview focuses on Bonaparte's intention to invade Britain, a subject which was a real cause for concern in Britain despite the scorn expressed by 'John Bull' in this broadside. Bonaparte's attempt to invade Britain was thwarted in 1805 by Admiral Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar.

James Aytoun (1797-1881), a native of Kirkcaldy, was a manufacturer and a supporter of Chartism. In 1841 he stood as a Radical parliamentary candidate for Stirling. This ballad is very supportive of Aytoun and was probably composed by someone with Radical sympathies. Although he is not a particularly notable figure in Scottish political history, Aytoun does appear in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, in a collection of calotypes taken by David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson between 1843 and 1847.

This song admirably illustrates the role of broadsides in the entertainment of their society. This text is obviously satirising and commenting on a political leader's conduct and behaviour in his public role. Unfortunately, not enough information is given to clarify the person and the conduct for modern readers. This suggests that this situation and information would have been instantly recognisable to the original reader and pertinent to his or her daily life.

This letter was sent by Thomas McCulloch from Sydney, Australia, on the 21 October 1821 to his unnamed wife in Glasgow. McCulloch was one of the nineteen men sentenced to transportation for attempting an armed insurrection at Bonnymuir, near Bonnybridge. They were part of a larger movement of 'radicals' who were campaigning for political representation and rights amongst the more skilled labourers, such as weavers and smiths. This letter was a further attempt at political agitation, with its descriptions of a 'better land' and reminders of the men who lost their liberty for political freedom.

The author is named as 'A LOOKER ON' and the sheet is dated 5th September 1832. There are no further publication details given. 'Sciolistic', which appears in the first sentence, is a word referring to someone with unjustified pretensions to knowledge.
This report accuses a 'Letter fo a fellow Elector' of prematurely celebrating the success of Captain George Elliot (1784-1863) ahead of the 1832 General Election, the first election after the passing of the Reform Bill. The National Library of Scotland hold other broadsides supporting Elliot's campaign in the Roxburghshire constituency. Elliot was a Whig, and the son of Gilbert Elliot, 2nd Earl of Minto, who was Whig MP for Roxburghshire from 1812-14. He was captain of H.M.S. Victory from 1827-1832. His Tory opponent, one of the 'Two competitors in the field of Roxburgh' mentioned here, was Lord John Douglas Scott, (1809-1860). Elliot was victorious on this occasion but was defeated by Scott in 1835.
The Parliamentary Reform Bill of 1832 increased the number of Scottish MPs from 45 to 53, and extended the vote in the burghs to households with an annual value of £10. This enlarged the voting base in Britain from 6 per cent of the population to 12 per cent, and inevitably led to competition between politicians and parties to win the support of the new voters. Among the tools used by the opposing sides were broadsides which argued the merits of the respective candidates. These were probably the forerunners of modern election campaign literature.",Broadside entitled 'Whiggery's Withered Trunk Put Forth a Leaf',1832

If the speaker on the 23rd of February, 1784, lives in the neighbouring city, and pays no stent [rent] to the town, and no tax to the poor, and does not own the authority of the Provost, nor even the power of a town-officer, to seize a delinquent in a neighbouring city, what right had he to speak in that meeting?' Although no publication details are included on the sheet, the first query includes the date, the 23rd of February, 1784.
This light-hearted broadside appears to refer to some obscure incident that took place during a meeting in Glasgow in 1784. The reference in 'Query 10' to the India bill appears to allude to Prime Minister William Pitt's (1759-1806) India Act of 1784. Likewise, the mentioning of 'the Fox' could be a reference to Charles James Fox (1749-1806), who was a Whig statesman. The India Act of 1784 was passed to regulate the affairs of the East India Company in India, and placed the Company under the under a Board of Control. It appears that this broadside notice is asking the citizens of Glasgow for their opinions on this matter.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

It is dated 4th July 1832.
The Parliamentary Reform Bill of 1832 increased the voting base in Britain from 6 per cent of the population to 12 per cent. This inevitably led to competition between politicians and parties to win the support of the new voters, and among the tools used by the opposing sides were campaign leaflets like the one shown here. The candidate it recommends, Captain George Elliot, (1784-1863) clearly supported the Reform Bill, and was a Whig. He was captain of H.M.S. Victory from 1827-1832. He was the son of Gilbert Elliot, 2nd Earl of Minto, who was Whig MP for Roxburghshire from 1812-14.  Lord John Douglas Scott, (1809-1860), was a prominent Tory and opponent of the Reform Bill. Efforts to present him to the new electorate as a 'reformer' are ridiculed here. Elliot defeated Scott in the first election after the passing of the Reform Bill in 1832, but the tables were turned in the election of 1835.

The 'letter' is signed 'TOM PEEP', dated 7th October 1807 and was sent from 'Ancient Burgh, E*******h'.
The 'letter' reproduced here was probably never sent to the 'Sunday Review' but was more likely written specifically to be printed on this broadside, for public entertainment. The subject is the local council election of 1807, and the author appears to be mocking the various candidates and parties involved.

Written in a satirical manner, the author of this amusing political broadside starts off in funereal style by reporting the recent 'death' of Edinburgh Town Council. Showing little respect for the 'dead', the writer almost indulges in schadenfreude as he follows the traditional Scottish custom of issuing a damning verdict on the town council and its 'Legacy' of high taxes. After this rather brutal opening, the writer then lists the names of the people serving on the council, complete with their constituencies. As this list contains the job titles of the councillors, it reveals much about the type of people who stand for election, with lawyers, architects, tradesmen and merchants predominating.

The broadside does not carry the name of its publisher, nor its place or date of publication.
Radicals and Whigs are often regarded as been different wings of the same party, and eventually the two groups did unite to form the modern Liberal Party in 1859. However, in the 1830s and 1840s quite bitter opposition existed between Whigs and Radicals. The Whigs had been responsible for pushing through the Parliamentary Reform Bill of 1832, but many Radicals felt that it did not go far enough, and later supported the Chartists' manifesto for electoral democracy. This speech by one of the Radical candidates for Glasgow in December 1832 highlights the enmity, accusing Edinburgh Whigs of attempting to control and manipulate candidates and voting in Glasgow.

This broadside claims to carry a faithful translation of a speech by Pierre-Samuel DuPont de Nemours (1739-1817), although the headline suggests that the broadside author opposes Dupont's beliefs.  DuPont, the son of a watchmaker, was a precocious humanities student whose philosophical study of economics, 'Physiocracy', influenced the famous Scottish economist and philosopher Adam Smith (1723-90). DuPont was elected president of the post-Revolutionary National Assembly in 1790, but by 1797 his moderation as a political reformer had turned radical elements in the government against him, and he was imprisoned. In later life he was a leading opponent of Napoleon Bonaparte's government, and was forced to flee France for America after Napoleon's return from exile on Elba.

The report implies that the two convicts were somewhat taken aback by their sentence.

Due to confusion among the witnesses, however, only Maxwell and Hamilton were found guilty, with a not proven verdict being returned for Muir and Donelly. As the rule of law during this turbulent era mainly existed to protect property, the two guilty men received the death sentence - though it appears that only Maxwell was executed, after confessing that he alone was responsible for the crime.

Executed outside Newgate on the 20th of June 1825, there was a general feeling that Probert had at last received what he deserved.

Part of a sequence of broadsides dedicated to a murder that took place in Gilmerton, this second edition broadside informs readers about the court proceedings and subsequent sentence, with a detailed mention of the evidence. Found guilty of the murder, the magistrate sentences John Thomson and David Dobie to death, with their bodies being spirited away immediately after execution for dissection in an anatomy class. The broadside concludes with the observation that although Thomson trembled at the sentence, Dobie impudently - and rather imaginatively - informed the sentencing judge that 'They cannot dissect the soul'.

This broadside was published in Edinburgh, by Menzies.
Robert Tennant had a drinking problem and had flown into a rage and killed his 70-year-old foreman when asked to leave his job because of it. This broadside is one of several which the National Library of Scotland holds relating to this case, and is interesting especially for its style; the majority of the text is in note form, as though it has been taken directly from a reporter's notepad.

Although there are no publication details available for this sheet, the subject matter suggests it was most likely published during the 1830s.
The cynicism of this political broadside will certainly strike a chord with modern-day readers. This sheet is a Radical Party interpretation of an electoral contest that took place in Edinburgh during the 1830s. As James Aytoun's electoral rival is only identified as the Tory candidate, 'Jack the Coachmaker' and it is very difficult for modern-day readers to discover this man's proper identity. The sheet is illustrated with a woodcut depicting the Edinburgh coat of arms. The National Library of Scotland's collection contains a number of political broadsides which highlight electoral campaigns in Edinburgh during this period.

The poem itself begins: 'Alas! The people now do sigh and moan, / For the loss of Wm. Ewart Gladstone'. It has been signed by the poet. Gladstone (1809-98) was a former Liberal Prime Minister.
McGonagall has gone down in history as one of the worst poets in the English language. Born in Dundee around 1825, he began his working life as a handloom weaver. It was not until 1877, however, when he was in his late forties, that he 'found his muse'. Throughout his 25-year career, he always remained convinced of his own genius. He died in 1902.

The broadside was published by Sanderson of Edinburgh, and the report was apparently taken from the 'Edinburgh Witness', which in turn had the 'Sun' newspaper as the source of the story. It is dated Wednesday, September 15th 1852, and at the foot of the broadside a handwritten annotation has added 'Confirmed by Electric Telegraph of Today - 15 September'. 
Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington (1769-1852) was born in Dublin and educated at Eton. His early life combined soldiery and politics, and while Tory MP for Rye in Sussex he co-ordinated several important military victories in Europe. In 1815 he was hailed as a hero in Britain after commanding the army that defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. From 1818 Wellington devoted himself to politics. He served as Prime Minister from 1828 to 1830, but his popularity with many suffered due to his refusal to condemn the Peterloo Massacre in 1819 and his opposition to parliamentary reform in 1832. His death in 1852 was nevertheless marked by national mourning and a grand state funeral.This broadside shows the impact the telegraph had in spreading news around the country.

A farmer's pregnant wife has a dream that she will be delivered of a son. True enough, her son is born the next day but proceeds to give the assembled company a prediction of doom and gloom. He forecasts war, recurring Jacobite tensions and problems over the Union of Parliaments. The baby then unfortunately dies.

The woodcut included at the top of the page depicts a well-dressed gentleman who appears to be rather agitated. There is no further information attached to this broadside.
The picture at the top of the sheet, may have helped enhance the understanding of the sheet for those who had limited comprehension skills. The fact that it is a gentleman, as indicated by his clothes, and that he does appear agitated furthers the themes of political dissension contained in the text. The swings and roundabouts of Whig versus Tory politics dominated the power arena from the reign of Queen Anne (1702-14), until the rise of the Labour party in the early twentieth century. James Aytoun (or Ayton) (1797-1881) was prominent in Edinburgh local politics in the 1830s.

The letter is signed, 'Your known friend, TIMOTHEUS SYNTAX, for J LEARMONTH'. Although there are no publication details available for this sheet, the subject matter suggests it was most likely published during the 1830s.
This highly amusing broadside pokes fun at politicians in general, and at John Learmonth (1789-1858), in particular. Owner of the Dean Estate, John Learmonth was Lord Provost of Edinburgh in 1832. Given the libellous nature of the address, it is clear that Learmonth himself did not write this broadside - hence the classical pseudonym, 'Timotheus Syntax'. The address also mentions two other famous politicians of that era, namely Robert Adam Dundas and Sir John Campbell.

It was printed in Edinburgh 'for the Booksellers', and priced at one penny.
Since the prophecy relates to the year 1831, it is safe to assume that this broadside was published in or around that year. The prediction itself, whilst rather obscure, suggests that 1831 will be a year of 'myghtie trobelles' during which the country will be on the brink of destruction. However, it is also suggested that Scotland will saved by men abounding in virtue and talent.

David Ross apparently taught his preachings from a house in Great Dove-hill called 'The Church of Smyrna'. His 'shuttle', presumably the spirits which communicate through him, had been venting their spleen on the Established Church and, in particular, the Glasgow College. Also, he claimed that a woman companion he had with him was 800 years old! The author of this report, unsurprisingly, is highly sceptical of Ross's claims and seems to find him ridiculous!

It was printed by William Carse of Glasgow. The report is not dated.
The headline of this broadside indicates the willingness of publishers to sensationalise reporting in order to gain readers. The smaller print reveals that rape was actually committted only in the second case, whereas in the first case it was fortunately averted. The law and press opinion in nineteenth-century Scotland were often prejudiced against women, but in Robertson's case, despite the jury's recommendation for mercy, the judge imposes the maximum penalty of death.

Published by J. Johnstone.
Apparently the prophecy, written in ancient Celtic, foretold Napoleon's rise and fall and Queen Caroline's trial and acquittal in 1820, amongst other things. It also prophesies that the National Debt would increase so much the British economy would collapse in 1823 and that between 1821-6 there would be great slaughter in the sister kingdom, France, and also that the Turkish Empire would fall, as it did.
After the report of the prophecy a 'curious prayer' is included, 'to fill up the paper'. It was apparently uttered by an old hawker of ballads and earthenware who lodged in one Mr Gregg's barn.

Shocking reports such as this one were standard fare for broadside pedlars. The more sensational the story, the more popular the broadside was likely to be. This one uses highly emotive language to describe both incidents and ends by stating that 'Serious crime is now increasing to an alarming extent' and giving details of others due to be tried for similar offences.

William Robertson was convicted of assaulting, wounding and raping a woman near Fife. He was sentenced to execution for the crime.

As outlined above, this broadside dramatically tells the story of how Duncan MacMillan was found guilty by a jury - meeting behind closed doors yet still naming the victim - of assaulting and intending to ravish Jean McLauchlane. As the jury returned a 'not proven' verdict for the rape charge, the sentence was mitigated from death to transportation. After concluding the main story, the broadsheet then gives a general court round-up of other crimes.

There are two related, humorous reports included on this broadside. The first, part of which is quoted above, is reproduced from the 'Scotsman' newspaper. Its author parodies religious chauvinism, claiming that the occurrence of an old woman preaching in Edinburgh's Tolbooth Kirk is evidence that 'THE CHURCH IS IN DANGER'. He also satirises Thomas Chalmers (1780-1847), the prominent evangelist and social reformer, claiming that the old woman's actions disprove Chalmers' fears about the spread of heathenism in Scotland.

It may well be a reference to the series of disputes in the Church of Scotland which eventually led to the Disruption of 1843.
The Disruption was the culmination of a long-standing series of disputes between the evangelical and moderate wings of the Church of Scotland. Although there were various doctrinal differences, at the heart of the crisis was the debate about who had the right to choose a minister. The evangelicals believed that the congregation should vote for the minster, while the moderates believed that the local landowner or patron should have the final decision.

Although no date of publication is included, the sheet was published by T. Duncan of Glasgow.
This broadside tells the story of John Fox from Nottingham, who, according to local ministers, was possessed by the devil for a short period, before he was finally cured. Despite what the writer claims, however, it is far more likely that poor Fox suffered some sort of mental breakdown, than the devil took over control of his soul. Indeed, it is interesting to note that rather than calling a doctor to treat Fox, he was instead treated by a collection of religious ministers. During a supernatural age such as this one, however, the fate of a person's soul was considered of vital importance - hence the emphasis on Fox's return to the path of religious righteousness following his miraculous cure.

Written in verse form, the opening line of the dialogue reads: 'Whaur gat ye the bawbees? / My boy Tammy'. A note below the title states that these lyrics should be sung to the tune, 'My Boy Tammy'. Although no date is given, a footnote states that it was published by 'SANDERSON, Printer, 36. Cowgate-head, Edinburgh'.
The story behind this peculiar ballad-cum-dialogue centres on the mysterious origins regarding where Tammy got his pile of bawbees from - a 'bawbee' being a halfpenny. It seems likely that this dialogue is intended as a satire on 'The Free Kirk', who were commonly known as the 'Bawbee-kirk'. The newly formed Free Church, was, in 1844, deeply in need of financial support, for this reason it sent a deputation to the United States to raise funds. This broadside is an attack on the acceptance by William Cunningham (part of the deputation) and the others, of contributions towards Free Church funds from the Presbyterian churches in the slave-holding states of America. Thomas Chalmers (Tammy) was at this time the Moderator of the new Free Church.

He implored the Church to 'send back the money' they had accepted from the slave owners.

The first verse of the eulogy begins: 'Cretians and Grecians were deemed were, to be / Liars , of old, by antient poesie; / But Greek Phocylides speaks lofty Truth, / With Precepts grave, instucting florid Youth.' Although no date is included, this sheet is likely to have been published in the early eighteenth century.
Written in a lofty and epic style, this eulogy pays tribute to two famous Scots: Patrick Hume, First Earl of Marchmont (1641-1724), and Sir Hugh Dalrymple, Lord of Drummore (1700-53). As both men were opponents of the Stewart family and the Catholic faith, it is likely that this broadside is an example of Protestant propaganda. Hume and Dalrymple were also strong supporters of the Act of Union of 1707, between the Scottish and English parliaments. Dalrymple is also famous for inventing hollow-pipe drainage, which allowed waterlogged land to be dried, thereby increasing agricultural production.

Defoe replies: 'Hail dread Tribunal! Reverend Machine, / Of awfull phyz, and formidable mein!' No publication details are on the sheet.
English-born Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) was put in the pillory (or stocks), in July 1703, and this piece was probably written around that time or shortly afterwards. Defoe was subjected to this public humiliation for the publication of a pamphlet, 'The Shortest Way with Dissenters'. This was an attack on the High Church, written as if from its viewpoint, but extending its arguments to the point of ludicrousness. Both the Church and Dissenters took it seriously and were outraged when they discovered it was a hoax. When put on the pillory, however, Defoe was hailed a hero, and flowers were thrown instead of the usual rocks. He wrote a celebrated poem about his experience, 'Hymn to the Pillory', the same year.

This bawdy and irreverent broadside fondly commemorates the passing of Mr Samuel Smith, whose parish was the infamous Newgate Prison, and whose flock consisted of 'Newgate Burds'. Judging by the verses to this epitaph, Smith appeared to take a rather mercenary approach to tending his flock, and it seems he would willingly convert prisoners into saints if the garnishing fee were to his pleasing. Indeed, the epitaph's numerous references to the rope suggest that Mr Smith's main vocation in life was to attend to those prisoners who were awaiting the death sentence.

This is a summary of some of the principal events in the books of the Bible, laid out chronologically and in verse form. All sixty-six books are mentioned, and the ballad is divided into two verses echoing the division of the Bible into the Old and New Testaments. The ballad was probably written as an act of devotion, but also perhaps as a way to help Christians remember the names, events and sequence of the books of the Bible. In the nineteenth century, when this broadside was published, adults and children were expected by many Christian churches to have a comprehensive Biblical knowledge.

The Oath of Abjuration, referred to in the title, was originally enforced by King William III (William of Orange) during a time of much religious and political struggle. It was introduced as part of the Security of Succession Act of 1702, and required the taker of the oath to renounce their allegiance to the Stuarts and the Church of Rome. Initially intended for those in public office, in many places it was required of most of the adult male population. This broadside is written from the Protestant perspective and, as such, welcomes the instigation of the oath.

John Muir was a prolific court proceedings publisher in Glasgow who was often involved in stiff competition with other Glasgow publishers.

It was first published by J. Morren of Edinburgh and re-published by Thomas Duncan, Saltmarket, Glasgow.
Richard Broxup was executed for crimes that by today's standards would seem fairly minor: he was charged with opening a chest or chest of drawers in three separate properties, and with stealing clothing from a fourth. The penalty of death for such an apparently petty offence was not unusual in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Scotland. In fact, execution was the usual punishment for those caught stealing or housebreaking.

The poem then opens: 'My loving countrymen pray lend an ear / Unto these relations I bring you to hear.' It was published by John Smith of Edinburgh.
Poems or ballads designed for moral instruction were a common subject of broadsides. Often they would be attributed to a condemned, repentant prisoner although probably written by an anonymous journalist. In this case it seems more likely that John Revel did have personal input, as the details of his life in Australia are very specific, and the poetic style is less formulaic than in other moral poems and lamentations of the time. This is a good example of how broadsides can provide insight into various levels and experiences of past British society.

It was common for the publishers of broadsides to take information from other sources, most often newspapers, but sometimes other broadsides.

Also, the sorrowful Lamentation on this awful occasion.' The report was copied from the Edinburgh Star of Friday, 5th December 1823
The tone of this report is clearly intended to provide moral instruction for its readership. The opening prose passage, describing Thomas Black's reflections on his imminent execution, stresses how keen he is to admit his sins and gain Christian forgiveness before he dies. The subsequent 'lamentation' which is almost certainly not the work of Black, but of an anonymous newspaper or broadside reporter, re-emphasises Black's contrition and warns others of following in his footsteps.

A capital crime could inspire a whole series of broadsides, covering different aspects of the case such as the circumstances of the crime, the trial, the execution and the condemned's alleged last words. Lamentations also sometimes featured. These were poems written partly as warnings to the public not to follow a life of crime. Although most were probably composed by anonymous broadside journalists, they were usually written with the condemned criminal as narrator, and involved, as in this example, the criminal dreading his or her fate, repenting and asking for God's forgivness, as well as offering dire warnings to the audience.

The National Library of Scotland's collection also includes a broadside detailing the trial and sentence of Peter Henderon.

Whether these words were written or uttered by Henderon is not known for sure. The highly repentent and religious tone of this lamentation is found in the vast majority of last speeches that were printed.

This broadside reports on Glasgow's first quadruple execution. McKinlay and Buchanan were cotton-spinners from Glasgow, who broke into Bothwell Castle and stole various items of gold and silver. Although it was Buchanan's first offence, McKinlay was said to be a career criminal. Guthrie and Forbes were described as old offenders, who were 'given to idleness and thieving'. Both hailing from Paisley, Forbes was a cloth-lapper and Guthrie was a weaver. While the punishment will look severe to a modern audience, the 'Criminal Code' (the 'Bloody Code') that existed in Scotland from 1650 to 1850 meant that property was safeguarded at all costs - hence the death sentence.

The 'Edinburgh Weekly Journal' was established in Edinburgh in 1756, and continued well into the mid-nineteenth century. At this time it was based in Hanover Street, in the wealthy and fashionable area of the New Town in Edinburgh. It was common for information to be copied from other newspaper sources.

This account has been taken from the 'Glasgow Chronicle' and was printed as a broadside by John Muir of Glasgow.
The confession was sent to the editor of the newspaper by a minister, James Stuart, who was attending James Wilson or McLusky in prison. In his covering letter he suggests that 'it might serve to deter others'. In many of the broadsides published in Scotland during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Catholicism was portrayed in a somewhat negative light. In Wilson's confession for instance he mentions his parents religious persuasion before discussing their 'unhappy and disagreeable life'.

The charges described in this broadside all relate to a riot that occurred during an Orange Walk in Girvan, Ayrshire. Although the date is not given on the broadside, these are probably some of the lesser cases emerging from a serious riot in Girvan on 12th July 1831, in which a Special Constable was killed and several more injured. The riot was part of a series of confrontations between Orangemen and Reform Movement protestors that blighted Girvan from April until October 1831.

The report contained in this broadside describes how a group of Glasgow citizens were arrested for trying to tear down walls and fences that obstructed a former public footpath by the Clyde. References to 'the Proprietor' and 'the works' suggest that the walls were built as part of a new industrial complex. The phenomenal expansion of Glasgow from town to industrial metropolis between the late-eighteenth and early-twentieth centuries inevitably impinged on the living standards and recreation of many of its people.

The rioting reported in this broadside apparently started following an argument, between a Scotsman known as Heron and an Irishman named Thurrel, over 'the fatal battle between Sandy Mckay and Symon Burn'. The battle referred to was a boxing match, which took place on 2 June 1830 at Salcey Green, between Simon Byrne, the Champion of Ireland, and Alexander (Sandy) Mckay, the Champion of Scotland. Byrne was arrested for the murder of McKay, who died of brain damage the day after the fight. Following a trial weighted in his favour, however, the jury returned a not guilty verdict and Byrne walked free.

The report attributes this riot to an unprovoked assault by an Irishman and decribes a battle which pitched locals against Irishmen. It is impossible to know if the report is fair, but it certainly reflects tension between native Scots and Irish incomers. Anti-Irish propaganda was widespread in nineteenth-century Scotland due to continuing intolerance of Roman Catholicism, an influx of Irish workers to the industrial lowlands of Scotland and British government opposition to Irish Home Rule. In the last respect 1823 was a particularly sensitive year, when Irish Home Rule campaigner Daniel O' Connell formed the Catholic Association to agitate for Catholic voting rights.

The letter is dated September 26th, 1821.
The incident described here was apparently provoked by a family of Irish gypsy origins, who had travelled to the Borders from Glasgow to seek work during the Harvest. It is alleged that having been deprived of work by local sheep-shearers, the Doughertys drunkenly recruited assistance from other Irish shearers and attacked the townspeople of Lauder. It is impossible to know how fair this account is. Religious bigotry and the issue of Irish Home Rule made anti-Irish sentiment common in nineteenth-century Scotland, and the prejudice of the letter-writer is evident in some places, such as the snide reference to the Irish shearers as 'the Pats'.

In Roxburgh Street Chapel in Edinburgh's south side, a man named Leckie had, for several weeks, been delivering lectures against the Roman Catholic religion. The meetings were normally well-attended and, although some debate between people of different faiths occurred, there was very little trouble. However, on this occasion fighting broke out and 'considerable damage' was done to the church.

Whilst the story originally appeared in London, this particular copy was printed by an Edinburgh publisher.
The account goes on to reveal that a man of unknown identity took to the pulpit and preached to those assembled on the subject of 'The Unity of the Spirit and the Bond of Peace'. It is further reported that a fight broke out over perceived anti-government sentiments contained in his sermon. The commotion resulted in the minister locking himself in the vestry!

The sheet was published by Francis McCartney of Edinburgh in May, 1833, and the story was sourced from 'The Caledonian Mercury' of May the 16th, 1833.
This broadside tells of a political meeting at Coldbath Fields, London, that somehow ended up as a calamitous riot. Held on the 16th of May, 1833, the meeting was organised by ordinary working men who wanted an increase in their wages. It seems that the police, with batons drawn, marched on the 1,000 attendees at the meeting, leading to fighting and, tragically, the fatal stabbing of one policemen, PC Robert Cully. The reference to the then home secretary, Lord Melbourne (1779-1848), shows that, although the authorities tried to legislate against such meetings, many people chose to defy the law and attend these political gatherings.

A note at the foot of the sheet states that it was 'Printed for Fergus Ferguson, Bookseller'. Unfortunately, the sheet is not dated.
This broadside news report offers its audience an exciting glimpse into the criminal underworld, as it describes a violent struggle that took place between smugglers and excise men. It was certainly a bloody confrontation, with three smugglers being killed and seven excisemen being wounded. Frustratingly, the sheet does not specify the exact location of where this incident took place or when it happened. However, it seems highly likely that St John's Haven is an early version of Johnshaven, which is an isolated fishing village located on the Aberdeenshire coast. Combining the fact that the 'Preventive Waterguard' was formed in 1809 with the story's reference to the King, places the publication date of this sheet between 1809 and 1837.

Although it is claimed that the Brother is 'well known' no further details are included on the sheet.

The sheet was published by Francis McCartney of Edinburgh.
This broadside contains a fantastical story concerning the Lazarus-like return journey experienced by an unidentified clergyman in London. In short, this minister had apparently died and was laid out in his burial clothes, only to miraculously reappear back into the world of the living. While unconscious, however, the minister imagined himself on the verge of passing through heaven's gate but, despite the enticing harmonious music, for some reason could not bring himself to enter into God's heavenly kingdom. Instead, the minister chose to return to the worldly kingdoms of Britain and Ireland, where he brings good news through his visions that peace will soon replace war. Religious propaganda such as this would have been commonplace at this time.

Although William Sankey appears to have been a prominent figure in his day, little is known of him today. It is clear from this broadside that he was a controversial figure who aroused a great deal of religious debate. A large number of broadsides focused on the frictions surrounding religious differences. In a predominantly presbyterian country such as Scotland, there would have been very few people who did not have an opinion on such matters.

The broadside was published by John Campbell of Edinburgh. It is not dated.
This broadside refers to rioting in Paris to mark the anniversary of the death of the Duke de Berri. Charles, Duke de Berri, second son of King Louis XVIII of France (1755-1824), was murdered at the Opera in Paris in 1820. The broadside also mentions Charles X of France (1757-1836) being at Holyrood House, which dates it to 1830 or later. Charles, successor to Louis XVIII, was deposed in 1830 and returned to Holyrood, where he had lived in exile during the French revolution and the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte. Charles' choice of Scotland as a sanctuary was probably influenced by the 'Auld Alliance' between the countries, which had existed since 1295.

Although no date is given on this particular broadside, it was probably printed around 1832 when England and Scotland both suffered virulent outbreaks of cholera.

This is a satirical poem on Philip V, Philip Anjou, King of Spain (1683-1746), who at the time (mid-1720s) was pursuing a reconciliation with Charles VI, Holy Roman emperor (r. 1711-40), in an anti-French alliance which would raise Jacobite hopes of an invasion of Great Britain. The poet, Alexander Pennecuik (1652-1722), was prolific during the first half of the eighteenth century and the National Library of Scotland's collection contains a number of his pieces.

A further note at the foot of the sheet states that it was published on Saturday the 27th of October, 1877.
Written in a lofty and epic style, this broadside poem tells of the tragic fate that befell Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (1542-87). The daughter of James V of Scotland and Mary of Guise, Mary Stuart made the fatal mistake of laying a claim to the English throne - a blunder that ultimately led to the executioner's platform. The poem offers its audience a condensed version of Mary's life story, recounting her childhood in France and turbulent adulthood in Scotland and England. Mary's tragedy can be viewed as one of circumstance, since she was a Catholic who tried to ascend to the English throne during the Reformation. Elizabeth I (1533-1603) had Mary executed in 1587, when it seemed that England was in danger of suffering a Spanish invasion. This work was composed by Henry Glassford Bell (1803-74), a poet and man of letters from Glasgow.
The Poet?s Box in Glasgow operated from 1849 to 1911. Matthew Leitch was the proprietor at 6 St. Andrew Lane?s, a narrow street on the south side of Gallowgate, from 1850 to 1858. His son William Munsie Leitch worked at the same address from 1859 to 1865 and at varous addresses in London Street until 1911. Many of the broadsides published by the Glasgow Poet?s Box were dated and some carried advertisements, not just for printed items but also for shoe blacking and ?soap for lovers?! Like the other ?boxes? in Dundee and Edinburgh, the Glasgow one sold love songs, sea shanties, parodies and dialogues. It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one in Paisley in the early 1850s owned by William Anderson.

Unfortunately, a date has not been included on this particular broadside. The doctor's lamentation, however, is most likely directed towards the protestant ruler, King George I (r. 1714-27). The first Hanoverian king, he was criticised by the British people for not learning English and for his apparent allegiances to Hanover over Britain. The author of this piece suggests that if the King visited Scotland, his presence would be rewarded with the loyalty of the people. This was a direct criticism of the King's system of governing, whereby the administration of the British Isles was left in the hands of his government.

Corn laws were introduced into Britain in 1815 to try and protect the extortionate price of grain. The demand for grain was high, as imports were blocked by the Napoleonic Wars and so producers could charge pretty much what they wanted. The poor and those who lived in industrial areas, and so were forced to buy food rather than grow their own, found this particularly restrictive. The laws were repealed in 1846 by Robert Peel, but only after violent opposition and many failed potato and corn harvests.

As stated in the introduction to this broadside, Caroline of Brunswick (1768-1821), the estranged wife of King George IV (1762-1830), was refused admittance to the coronation. Banned from the royal court in 1811, Caroline moved overseas and did not return to Britain until her husband, the Prince Regent, was declared King in 1820. She returned in anticipation of becoming Queen, but was met with the offer of a bribe to remain in exile. After Caroline refused to accept his bribe, the King unsuccessfully tried to divorce her. The final shock of being refused admittance to the coronation, is thought to have contributed to her demise the following month. Despite being shunned by the King for most of their marriage, Caroline always proved a popular figure with the British public.

Judging by the hotchpotch, regal nature of the people who appeared in this pageant of shoemakers, there may have been a slightly subversive element about this procession. Indeed, the saturnalian nature of the Midsummer Solstice is linked to the anti-establishment festivals that were known as the 'Lords of Misrule' days.

St Cripsin is the patron saint of shoemakers, due to the prominent part shoemaking plays in his life story and preaching. He was martyred on the 25th October, sometime in the 3rd century A.D. As a result, his processional day, organised by the shoemakers, cobblers and cordwainers' guild, and taken as holiday by them, occurs on this day. This sheet reveals the details of the procession held in Edinburgh, and suggests that there was some opposition to it being held.

A note at the foot of the sheet states it was 'PRINTED FOR JOHN CAMERON', whose press was located in Glasgow during the 1820s.
Employing martial terminology to report on a domestic quarrel that allegedly took place between a cobbler and his wife, this gossipy broadside is really a humorous story which has been written to entertain its audience. That said, however, a censorious tone concerning how people should behave lends an element of moral instruction to the tale. The story centres around the seemingly universal theme of a man going to a pub in order to forget all his woes, only to have his leisure time interrupted by an angry wife. The opening reference to King Crispian is probably intended to be a humorous comparison between this pub-frequenting cobbler and Saint Crispin of Soissons (d. 287), who was the patron saint of shoemakers.

Whilst the date of July 1789 has been handwritten near the top of the sheet, the events recounted in this broadside occurred in 1798.
The rebels in this instance were the United Irishmen who fought during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. Formed in 1791 by Theobald Wolfe Tone, the United Irishmen's ultimate goal was independence from Britain. Although in the initial stages the aim was to achieve change through legislative reform, a revolutionary zeal inspired by the French Revolution soon took over. During the 1798 Rebellion, the rebels achieved success in County Wexford only to be defeated soon after by British troops at Vinegar Hill (June 1798).

The inclusion, at the bottom of the sheet, of the translations for many of the Scots words, suggests that this song was not just for circulation in Scotland, but also in England, Wales and possibly Ireland. This is further supported by the fact that many of the veiled references to Scotland's military heroes have had to be further explained! This sort of attempted translation is not at all unusual and can be found on other sheets held in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

The 42nd regiment, original the 43rd until 1749, is better known today as the 'Black Watch'. The regiment's history stretches back to 1739, although it has undergone many changes and affiliations since then, and was closely associated with the Earls of Crawford. Unfortunately A. Robb of the 42nd is now largely untraceable, although this little document is an interesting testament to his skills and a brief history of his career.

The Christian Union was a loose organisation of Christian faiths, who shared the core values of conviction, vision and strategy. Today, the organisation is vast and covers all sections of society.  Campbell and Henshall completed a tour of Scotland trying to promote the fellowship. Their tour, however, was dogged by Anti-Slavery campaigners and, as a result, the whole affair caused quite a stir.

This well-composed short poem, probably from the early part of the eighteenth century, describes a horse race which took place in Leith, near Edinburgh. Some of the people involved are named; 'Jedburgh' and ''Squair Lyle', but it is the 'Highland Ladie' and his horse who are eulogised. The author takes great delight in pointing out that the arrogant Yorkshireman's gray horse was not as good as it was made out to be and the 'home grown' (and modest) Scots horse and rider won.

The National Library of Scotland holds another broadside report of this prizefight that is almost identical to this one apart from the introductions. This is revealing about the way broadside publishers operated. In cases where they sourced material from newspapers, often little attempt was made to paraphrase or adapt the original reports. Immediacy was more important than originality, so two broadside publishers might compete to sell virtually the same words, as in this case. There was no properly regulated or enforced copyright law in Britain until the early twentieth century.

The broadside was published by Alexander Turnbull of Edinburgh and was priced at one penny.
Pre-arranged bareknuckle prizefights between men were not uncommon in early nineteenth-century Scotland, and sometimes inspired broadside reports. The encounter described in this broadside, a spontaneous fist fight between two women, was a far rarer spectacle, as the broadside author points out. The details of the fight are described with great enthusiasm by the author, which lends a certain amount of hypocrisy to the moralising conclusion of the report: 'The condition of both the amazons was truly disgraceful, and said little for the humanity of the spectators.'

A second report is also included which details the execution of Barney McGuire on June 7th 1830. This sheet, which cost a penny to buy, was printed for William Robertson.
Sensational stories such as these made extremely popular reading and were sold by the thousands. The sheets themselves were intended to be stuck to the wall for general reading and so had to appeal to a wide audience. This sheet features all the sensational aspects of crime reporting. The innocence of a poisoned competitor - a well-known Scottish prizefighter, Sandy MacKay (or M'Kay), references to other dark crimes, the gory details of the crimes and the repentance of a bad character. As with a lot of these reports parts of it have cribbed from other sources. Only one of these, however, has been attributed, the 'Glasgow Free Press'. MacKay or M'Kay was a West Highlander renowned for his strength and courage but was not a first-rate pugilist. His career included two victories over an Irishman Paul Spencer and a previous loss to Simon Byrne prior to their fatal second meeting. Byrne himself died in 1833 after a fight with James 'Deaf' Burke.
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers.

After naming the horses, riders and owners, the writer tells his audience the exact time when the race will start. Although the sheet was published in Edinburgh in 1728, the publisher is not identified.
Prior to the building of the docks at Leith in 1806, the sandy beaches that previously existed there had been perfect for horse-racing, recreational pursuits and military parades. Indeed, 'The Caledonian Mercury' (c. 1720) often carried public notices regarding horse-racing events on the beach at Leith. There are records of races on Leith sands going back to 1504. The list of owners here is particularly revealing, with a farmer, lord, earl, knight of the realm and an esquire all competing to win the £50 prize - about £4,700 in today's money. The building of the docks at Leith meant that these traditional horse-racing events were forced to move along the coast to the nearby town of Musselburgh.

All three rounds of this boxing match are described in detail although it appears as though there was no clear winner! At this time the boxers, or 'pugilists', would probably have played by Jack Broughton's rules, devised in 1743. Those rules, with only minor changes, governed boxing until they were replaced by the more detailed London Prize Ring rules in 1838.

It is noteworthy that this sheet was published in Kelso, since many of the broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection were produced in the larger urban centres such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee. James Palmer worked out of Kelso as a printer throughout the 1780s and 1790s, and produced a large number of broadsides - many of which dealt with local themes. This broadside could be considered a precursor to the society pages found in some modern-day newspapers and magazines. There was a great deal of interest, as there is today, in the comings and goings within the elite social circles of the upper classes.
Horse races had been held in the Kelso area since the early 18th century. The Duke of Roxburghe supported the meeting and was responsible for the laying out of a new and genuinely flat course (the present one) on the edge of the town at Berrymoss. Unlike other race meetings such as those at Leith and Paisley, Kelso races did not attract massive crowds, being generally confined to the landed classes.

The broadside does not carry the name of the publisher or the place of publication.
The striking thing about this account of a bareknuckle fight is its vivid use of colloquial expressions. These are numerous, but examples include the description of Halton as 'an ugly carrotty cropped Potatoe', the substitution of 'claret' for 'blood', and references to various parts of the body as 'smottock', 'puddingbag' and 'dexter ogle'. The spectators' disappointment with the fight is also memorably phrased: 'It was hunted that they had seen a better mill between a brace of haddy wives'. Halton was born in Dublin. He fought against Jack Langan, who twice challenged for the championship of England and was also defeated by the renowned Jewish fighter Aby Belasco.

Very little is known about either of these football teams although the Swifts were known to have been a Dundee team who played against Arbroath in 1880. That match was supposed to have decided whether supremacy lay with the city or the country. Dundee is renowned for its devotion to its football teams. Interest in football increased at the same rate as the spread of industrialisation as it was a constructive way to spend precious recreation hours. Dundee's football fascination is hardly surprising given its industrial orientation. The composer James Curran (or Currin) was a well-known Glasgow parodist.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

In the early nineteenth century bareknuckle prizefighting was a popular spectator sport, particularly among gamblers. It may be considered the ancestor of the modern sport of boxing, although prizefighting was far less controlled by tactical restrictions or by limits of time. The Queensberry Rules, which constitute the foundation of modern boxing, were introduced in 1857 partly to reduce the often terrible violence of the fights. This violence is evident in this broadside report, where a prizefighter dies from head injuries after a fifty-eight round fight.

There are many broadsides held in the National Library of Scotland's collection which detail boxing matches held up and down the country. This sheet is a fascinating blow-by-blow account of each round, which would no doubt have made for interesting reading for those who missed the fight. The language used in these reports, euphemistic and slang, seems to have been a feature common to most of them. John Crosbie was a Scottish pugilist about whom little is known. He was probably the Crosbie who fought a Londoner called Birrell in 1814 and almost certainly the one who beat a fellow Glaswegian called Carrick in 1818. Matt Robinson, from Yorkshire, was successful in two fights in Scotland (he also defeated Tom 'Scotch' Robertson). The Crosbie fight was reputedly his prize-ring debut. He died in Manchester in 1861.

Tragically, however, the fight took a terrible toll on Byrne, and he died three days later from his wounds. In an attempt to save his prize-fighting career, Burke emigrated to America.

Other editions of the same ballad mentioned that it was written by John Wilson of Glasgow. The broadside carries no publication details.
Songs like the 'The Orphan Boy', which used images of poverty to pull at the heartstrings of their hearers, were quite commonly found on broadsides especially in the late nineteenth century. It is likely that they were also intended to raise awareness of the poor social welfare afforded to orphaned and abandoned children. Interestingly, the first line of this song makes an explicit reference to another popular song on a similar subject, 'The Drunkard's Raggit Wean', which also appears on broadsides held by the National Library of Scotland.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

This poem was written by Janet Reid of Carnock. It was published by MacDonald of Carrubbers' Close, Edinburgh.
The MacDonald family worked in around Carrubbers' Close, Edinburgh from the 1820s  through to the 1870s, with both women and children being involved in the business in their own right. This broadside was published during a period of fervent temperance activity, as the plight of the working class was tackled by restricting access to beer and gin! Janet Reid (1777-1854) was a prolific author of ballads who travelled the country during the 1830s and 1840s selling broadsides. She was based in Carnock, near Dunfermline and later in Bridge of Allan.

The sheet was published by John Muir of Glasgow.
This fascinating broadside describes life from the former British penal colony of Botany Bay, Australia. Addressed to his wife, the letter was written by Thomas McCulloch, who was one of the 'The Bonnymuir Prisoners'. These men were Radicals who were transported for demanding some political rights, following a controversial trial in Stirling, in 1820. The letter reveals much about the five-month voyage to Australia, plus an explanation of the situation regarding wives and sweethearts being allowed to emigrate and join their menfolk. A whole sequence of sheets telling the story of 'The Bonnymuir Prisoners' is contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

The sheet was published in 1820 by John Muir of Glasgow.
As the decade following the end of the Napoleonic Wars is generally regarded as the era when Britain came closest to undergoing a revolution, the Establishment cracked down hard on sedition by enforcing the treason law with great severity. The trial report contained in this broadside is part of this wider historical context. Indeed, the delicate nature of this state trial certainly presented the authorities with a dilemma, a fact demonstrated by the long list of high-ranking judges named in the opening paragraph. The great sensitivity of this trial is also illustrated by the jury's careful decision to temper its guilty verdict, with a recommendation that James Wilson be shown mercy - a recommendation that fell on deaf ears.

The name of the publisher is not included on this sheet.
Andrew Hardie was executed in 1820, along with John Baird, for the audacious crime of being a 'Radical' and publicly demanding 'Freedom, Truth and Justice'. As the decade following Waterloo is regarded as the closest Britain ever came to undergoing a political revolution, the establishment enforced its sedition and treason laws with great severity - hence these executions. Hardie's letter to his uncle reads much like a political leaflet. The letter to his sweetheart, however, is far gentler in tone. A public memorial to Hardie and Baird can be found in Sighthill Cemetery, Glasgow.

' Dated July 13th, 1820, the sheet was published by W. Carse, Printer.
The formidable assembly of top legal minds listed in the introduction to this sheet illustrates what a sensitive and important case it was. 'The Bonnymuir Prisoners' were in fact political prisoners, as they were Radicals who had started demanding some political rights. However, since the decade following the Battle of Waterloo is generally regarded as the era when Britain came closest to undergoing a political revolution, the Establishment had to be very careful as to how this state trial in Stirling was conducted. The ringleaders, Andrew Hardie and John Baird, plus four others, were found guilty of treason, and were executed at Stirling in September, 1820.

The sheet was published in 1820 by John Muir of Glasgow.
As can be seen from the opening paragraphs to this broadside, a Special Commission comprised a large group of high-ranking judges who presided over cases that were especially sensitive. Although the four accused men are charged with high treason, frustratingly, the details of their alleged crimes are not mentioned. However, it seems likely that their alleged crimes were linked to widespread political unrest in Scotland, which in turn fits into the broader picture of political agitation unrest that existed throughout Britain at this time. Although Thomas McKay was sentenced to death, it is not clear if the sentence was in fact carried out - suggesting that the sentence may have been later commuted.

The sheet was published in May 1822  by John Muir of Glasgow.
Andrew White was implicated for his part in the Battle of Bonnymuir in April 1820. He was found guilty of High Treason and transported to Australia. Two of his fellow Radicals, John Baird and Andrew Hardie were hung, then beheaded, but White eventually returned to Scotland after the Radicals were pardoned in 1835.
In this letter home he describes life in the 'now respectable Colony' of Botany Bay.

This sheet was published by William Cameron of Edinburgh, and cost one penny.
Six thousand people turned up in Stirling in 1820 to witness the execution of the Radicals, Andrew Hardie and John Baird. These men were sentenced to death for publicly demanding their political rights, as part of the agenda for the Radical Movement. The broadside describes the execution in great detail, and reports that the two condemned men conducted themselves on the scaffold with great fortitude. The large number of soldiers present at the execution suggests that the authorities were fearful that the crowd might turn into a mob. Indeed, the crowd shouted 'Murderer!' at the headsman.

This sheet was published by Forbes and Owen of Edinburgh.
The business 'Forbes and Owen' went through many variations during its working career. It was initially known as Forbes and Owen for just over a year before changing to 'Forbes and Kay'. It was known as this for, again, just over a year. For the next two years the title 'Forbes and Co.' was used, before eventually being known as just 'J. Forbes'. The business disappears from the records altogether in November 1834. During this entire period mainly chapbooks and broadsides were produced. The broadsides covered most of the topical events of their time and in some of the most sensationalist styles.

The subject here is not a criminal trial, but the trial of a minister accused of arousing 'fanatical excitement' in his congregation. Reverend Tait, of College Church (possibly Trinity College Church) was called in front of the Presbytery of Edinburgh to answer charges of committing 'extravagances in a place of worship . . . by which all sobre persons were deeply scandalised'.

Printed in Glasgow for John Muir.
This trial report goes into great detail about the heinous crime committed by Robert Emond. He had killed his wife's sister, Mrs Franks, and her 14-year-old daughter in October 1829. Emond was composed at his trial, until the jury heard what he had said to his cellmates. When they asked him whether he had committed the crime, he apparently replied 'Oh, yes, but don't speak of it to me; for it goes like a knife into my heart whenever I think of it'. At this, there was a 'sensation in court' and Emond began to wail, or 'quail', dreadfully.

Tha National Library of Scotland's broadside collection also includes an elegy lamenting the death of 'Colonel Sara', who died in Leith on the 28th August, 1718. It seems very likely that Captain Sarah and Colonel Sara are the same person. Whilst little or nothing is known about this rather colourful and courageous character today, Captain Sarah must have been a popular and well-respected figure to warrant two lamentations.

At the bottom we are told that the piece was composed by 'the Bearer, William Catton', who was an ex-foot-soldier in General Folliott's regiment.
The Siege of Minorca took place in 1756, at the start of the Seven Years War, which pitted Britain, Prussia and Hanover against Austria, France, Russia, Saxony and Sweden. Sir William Blakeney (1672-1761), Lieutenant Governor of Minorca, was forced to surrender the island to the French after a famous defence. The author of this piece says he served there for eight years. It was not uncommon for pedlars to publish their own verse, and this is an excellent example.

Dalglish, or Dalgliesh (there are two different spellings on the broadside), was 'lockman' or hangman of Edinburgh, and this versified offer of a reward for George Fachney's arrest, 'alive or dead', is appropriately attributed to him. It was actually written by Alexander Pennicuik (d.1730), a burgess of Edinburgh who wrote poetry in the style of Allan Ramsay (1686-1758).

There are no publication details included on this sheet.
This clever and light-hearted broadside story is really a religious sermon disguised as a humorous tall tale. Briefly, a private soldier is taken before the city major for allegedly playing cards, under the camouflage of pretending to read a Bible while sitting in church. Warned that he faces a harsh punishment unless he can explain himself, the quick-thinking soldier shows the major how he reads the bible by identifying each card with a biblical story. This fictional story concludes with the major giving the soldier some money and beer, after telling him he is the cleverest man he has ever met.

With no copyright law in place, original works could be reproduced at will with no obligation to acknowledge or seek permission from the author.

Although a single capital crime was often the subject of a whole series of broadsides, lesser crimes were commonly summarised along with several others in round-ups of court proceedings, such as the one shown here. One of the notable aspects of this broadside is the severity of sentences that were passed even for minor misdeeds. One example is Janet Black, who was sentenced to seven years' transportation for stealing from a bleaching green. Underneath the report of her sentence it is noted: 'This girl is only ten years of age'.

No publication dates have been included on this sheet.
This account offers a fascinating insight into crime and punishment in eighteenth-century Scotland. The penalties for offences that by today's standards would seem fairly minor were extremely severe and unforgiving. Throughout the eighteenth century, and much of the nineteenth century, the common punishment for theft and housebreaking was execution. During this particular round of the Circuit Court, Elizabeth Paul, alias Wilson, was sentenced to be hanged for stealing cloth from a Paisley bleachfield.

In the first case, the accused, James Plunkett, attacked and robbed silversmith Robert Wilson. James Plunkett was sentenced to be executed on 26th October, but escaped from the Tollbooth on 11th October. A reward was offered for him, and he was apprehended at Aberbrothie (probably Arbroath) in Angus, but he was sent to the High Court in Edinburgh, where he eventually admitted his identity and was executed in Glasgow on January 11th 1792.

Vitriol is another name for sulphuric acid.
An argument broke out between Euphemia McMillan and Archibald Campbell, over a chair which had been laid across a doorway to prevent 'the child' from falling down the stairs. We are never told whose 'the child' was, or how it came to be in Campbell's house, perhaps having dancing lessons. Mrs McMillan caused a scene and was taken away by the police, but later returned to throw acid over Campbell's face. Mr McMillan appears to have had nothing to do with the incident.

It was published by John Muir of Glasgow, and probably cost one penny.
This broadside recounts the trial of forty 'Whiteboys' who stood trial in Cork.  Formed in Tipperary in 1761, 'Whiteboys' - who acquired their name from the white linen shirts they wore - were strongly opposed to changes that were occurring in Irish agriculture at this time. Believing in direct action, they took extreme measures often sabotaging farmland and targeting those in authority. The movement became so widespread that the Whiteboy Act was passed in 1765 in an attempt to curb their activities.

Printed in 1823.
Crime was one of the most popular subjects for broadsides, and in particularly infamous cases several separate broadsides might be produced, giving different accounts of the trial, sentencing and, where one followed, execution. In this case, the trial and sentencing are dealt with in the same broadside. The details of the murder are given plainly, as they were heard at the trial, and the judge's summing up after sentencing is reported in great detail. Broadsides catered to an audience with very definite tastes and expectations, and the amount of emphasis given to the judge's remarks on repentence and the afterlife reflects the devout presbyterianism practised by most Scots in 1823.

This account of an apparently unprovoked assault reflects some of the prejudices and concerns that were common in nineteenth century Scotland. Vagrancy would have met with strong suspicion and resistance in some quarters, particularly in smaller communities, and here the victim is attacked after his family have sought lodgings in a Scottish village. Moreover, there is an implication of racial and religious prejudice. At the start of the report, the victim's widow confirms her Protestantism 'with peculiar emphasis', and it is revealed that the victim is native to Ireland. The perceived 'danger' of Catholicism was a sensitive issue during this period of significant Irish migration to Scotland.

On the way home from Elgin Feeing Market, James Newlands, 39, and some others, stopped at a pub for a drink. After leaving the pub Newlands persuaded Jane Ross to walk on ahead with him, saying they would take a different road and meet the others shortly. Once they were alone, Newlands sexually assaulted the girl three times.

The taking of Mafeking was not particularly important strategically, although it played a huge part in boosting morale and was remembered fondly for the courage and determination of Baden-Powell and his troops. They were outnumbered four to one and were besieged for 216 days. This was also where Baden-Powell's Scout Movement began: he recruited a garrison of boys to act as messengers and orderlies, thereby releasing men to fight. He also devised other clever strategies to call the enemy's bluff. These included making imitation forts to draw enemy fire, and loudly shouting orders to non-existent attack troops!
McGonagall (c. 1830-1902) has gone down in history as one of the worst poets in the English language. Born in Dundee in 1830, he began his working life as a handloom weaver and it was not until 1877, when he was in his late forties, that he 'found his muse'.

It was published by James Dougherty of Edinburgh in 1824, priced at one penny.
Margaret Boag escaped with her life, instead being sentenced to transportation, because the murder charge against her was found not proven. This is a verdict unique to Scottish criminal law that tends to be used in cases where the jury or sheriff feels the defendant may be guilty but does not have substantial enough evidence to convict beyond reasonable doubt. Although heavily criticised in some legal quarters, the not proven verdict continues to be used today.

The Ottoman Empire, founded by the Mameluke Turks, dominated the politics and culture of the Near East for roughly four hundred years, between 1517 and 1917. Over this time the Ottoman territorial boundaries fluctuated, but there was a noticeable and sustained Ottoman presence in the Balkan area for this entire period. As a result, the Ottomans were in a constant, though not always widely-publicised, struggle with the Hapsburg Empire for control of this buffer-zone area. This makes it rather difficult to give this particular account a date or specific context.

There are other broadside reports of Robert Scott's case held in the National Library of Scotland's collection. This report mentions that Scott's body was be transported to the University of Edinburgh where it was to be used for dissection lectures by Dr Munro. This was a further punishment as the dissection of ones body was viewed with disgust and revulsion by society at the time.

The report is dated 16th April, but the year is not given, and the broadside carries no further publication details.
Some broadside crime reports were written in a highly melodramatic and emotive style which attempted to impress upon readers a sense of the horror of the crime and the wickedness of its perpetrators. The report on this sheet, however, appears to be almost a transcription of the court proceedings. The language is concerned only with the basic facts and the evidence presented by witnesses in the two cases described. In some places the author does not even try to construct proper sentences, instead writing paragraphs that are lists of statements or observations separated by semi-colons. This suggests that the report was written quickly, in an attempt to make it the first published account of the cases. Both Mackintosh and Gordon were hanged in Aberdeen in May 1822.

It seems that a detailed post-mortem was not carried out on the victim, as the exact cause of death seems unclear. Mary Elder is accused of poisoning her pregnant 25 year-old servant by mixing 'arsenic, or other poisonous substance' with 'water, or other liquid'.

Margaret Boag was convicted of theft, having been caught with clothing belonging to her neighbour Elizabeth Low. Low was found dead, wrapped in a carpet with an axe sitting beside her.

Bryce appears to have killed his wife's brother with fire tongs in order to steal money from him as he was often quite poor.

It was published by John Muir of Glasgow and is dated 30th April 1821.
The motivation for this bizarre-sounding murder appears to have been robbery. Pedlars were particularly vulnerable to assault, because their work took them far from their homes to areas where they were unknown, and because they carried their wares and takings with them. It is easy to see how a murderer might have escaped in 1821, before photography, mass media or efficient communications. Gordon had apparently been on the run for two months, and had travelled the length of the country, before he was finally captured at Nairn.

According to this report, the level of interest in Emond's case was tremendous. This is confirmed by the number of broadsides that were issued on the Emond murders, more familiarly known as the 'Haddington Murders'. In the National Library of Scotland's collection alone there at least five further broadsides,  including another detailing the trial and sentence, a letter Emond wrote to his wife, a summary of his life, history and transactions, a confession, and, finally, a report regarding his execution.

The sheet was published on July 15th, 1829, by John Muir of Glasgow.
The murder of Robert Lamont was the deed that brought Stewart and Wright to justice, but after their condemnation, Stewart laid claim to several more murders carried out in the same way. An interesting footnote to the case is that the boat where the murder occurred was named after Toward Castle, overlooking the Firth of Clyde, which is the ancient family seat of the Lamont clan. The victim having this name is more than coincidence - it suggests how in the nineteenth century, far more than today, Scotland's landscape was still discernibly divided into family areas.

Elphinstone met his estranged wife, who had been living with another man, in Libberton's Wynd near the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, and had an altercation with her. Her mother intervened and threw a pail of water at Elphinstone, who then stabbed her. She died 17 days later. It appears as though Elphinstone was a well-liked man and the outburst was very out of character. The judge seems to have felt pity for him but was unable to pass any other sentence for the crime of murder.

Charles McEwen, who was also known by five other names, killed Margaret Money, whom he had lived with 'as man and wife', by striking her on the head with an anvil.

It appears that Haggart had a history of escaping from jail, as he previously broke out of Leith Jail.

Printed for Wm. Robertson.
Part of a sequence of broadsides dedicated to this particular rape and murder, this news-sheet updates the horrific story by informing readers about the trial and subsequent sentence of the two murderers. The tone of the broadside is rather verbose and text-heavy, and this perhaps indicates that the anonymous writer was closely following a transcript of what the lawyers said in court, since proceedings were held behind closed doors. The closing paragraph describes how the prisoners were both found guilty and sentenced to death, with their bodies being sent to a medical school immediately after execution for dissection. It would appear that sending corpses straight from the scaffold to an anatomy class was an old tradition.

Published by Sanderson of the High Street, Edinburgh, on the 22nd June 1835.
This broadside tells the tragic story of a Private James Bell who, when refused leave by Sergeant-Major Moorhead, shot the officer dead with a pistol. After outlining the basic details of the incident, the sheet goes on to give an account of the trial and the case for the defence. Although the defence attempts to offer a plea of 'insanity', this is rejected and the mutinous soldier is found guilty and sentenced to death. It is interesting to note that this case was tried in a civil court rather than a military court, which is quite unusual.

This sheet was printed for George Craig and sold for a penny a sheet.
Beveridge was condemned for battering his wife, Janet Greig, to death with a heavy household implement and then trying to conceal his crime. This crime and the subsequent events were perpetrated in Little Jack's Close in the Cannongate, Edinburgh. There are many different people mentioned in the report, as the sensational details of the courtroom drama are relayed to the public.

15304,war,L.C.Fol.74(027),"This ballad begins: 'LET Suff'ring Europe lift her head, / Proud Bonaparte is humbled now, / His routed legions fleeing are, / Before brave Gen'ral Kutusow.' A note below the title states that the ballad should be sung to the tune of 'Green grow the Rashes O', which was written by Robert Burns in 1783. The sheet was published in 1812 by J. Morren of Edinburgh.
Napoleon Bonaparte's (1769-1821) epic retreat from Moscow during the Russian winter of 1812 led to much rejoicing in many European countries, and this ballad is dedicated to the fighting qualities of General Kutusov's (1745-1813) pursuing Russian Army. Following the dreadful Battle of Borodino in September 1812, Napoleon reached Moscow, only to find a virtually deserted city. Unable to march on St Petersburg due to the poor condition of his soldiers, he tried to reach a peace settlement with Tsar Alexander I. Unable to reach an agreement due to his vulnerable position, Napoleon had no option but to commence his famous retreat.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites. The term 'ballad' eventually applied more broadly to any kind of topical or popular verse.","Broadside ballad entitled 'The Corsican Humbled, or Bonaparte's Disasters in Russia'",1812

With the child being born in April 1820, and his age being 11 months, this broadside was most likely published in 1821. It was priced at one penny.
In the first paragraph of this account, the child is described as 'one of the greatest curiosities that ever appeared in the human world'. Details of his appearance are provided, along with the reactions of those who have seen him. The final paragraph eulogises on the wonderous work of God and the sanctity of all life, no matter what shape or form it takes. Despite the sentiments of the final paragraph, people would have been drawn to this story precisely because of the boy's alleged size. Inscribed opposite this broadside is a note transcribed from the Edinburgh Evening Courant, stating that the boy in question, James Weir, had died aged 17 months.

Vitriol is another name for sulphuric acid.
An argument broke out between Euphemia McMillan and Archibald Campbell, over a chair which had been laid across a doorway to prevent 'the child' from falling down the stairs. We are never told whose 'the child' was, or how it came to be in Campbell's house, perhaps having dancing lessons. Mrs McMillan caused a scene and was taken away by the police, but later returned to throw acid over Campbell's face. Mr McMillan appears to have had nothing to do with the incident.

As with many broadsides, there is no further information available about Isobel Frazer or her life. Broadsides were produced to fulfil the need for cheap, momentary entertainment, and the stories were often of a local nature to give the sheet increased appeal. Despite these drawbacks, the information given in this story about Isobel's attitude towards work and possessions, plus the list of chattels themselves, are useful to today's readers.

The sheet was published by A. Turnbull of Edinburgh, and cost one penny.
Through using the word 'battle' in its introduction, this amusing broadside makes a domestic quarrel between a husband and wife sound like the clash of the titans. A mock-epic in style, the story revolves around that proverbial Scottish saying regarding which one of a married couple 'wears the breeks' in the house. In short, who rules the roost? The author reports that the young wife was out with her friends, but returned home late and rather tipsy. Taking exception to such deviant behaviour, the husband starts arguing with her and - suddenly! - crockery and furniture is flying everywhere. Happily, the story ends with the couple reconciled via the drawing up of two official articles of agreement.

This rather chilling and gruesome tale is very revealing about Victorian relationships and society. The emphasis on marriage and childbearing is explicit here as well as the wife's frustration at her inability to fulfil this role. The husband then seeks a less tense relationship with the maid, which leads to her downfall. It is made clear that this is her fault and she should have resisted the husband's advances. In turn, the wife then claims that she too will have many men, an almost impossible claim to make good at this time.
Any references to the physicalities of the relationship have been left blank, but it does suggest that these topics were talked about by Victorian couples. Pregnancy is also not named in this text. Although having many children was the preferred state of affairs, pregnancy itself was thought to be quite disgusting and pregnant women were not supposed to show themselves in society.",Broadside entitled 'The Husband's Secret Let Out!',1830-1850

There are no publication details available for this broadside. However, a note at the bottom of the sheet states that it was 'Completed by a Lady of Honour'.
An epithalamium is a song or poem in celebration of a marriage. In this epithalamium, the author (a female, apparently) writes in a humorous vein about the marriage between Captain James Donaldson, a gazetteer and observator, and Mrs Jean Reid, alias Mrs Scot. Unfortunately, there does not appear to be further information regarding these two individuals, or the marriage. As for the poem, written in rhyming couplets, it is a mixture of the ribald, erudite and humorous - in short, exactly the sort of light-hearted tone that a wedding song should be.

I am thy husband; thou shalt have no other husband but me, whom thou didst vow to love, honour and obey; for I saved thee from old-maidenism, and rescued thee from the terror of single blessedness.' A note at the foot of the sheet states that it was published, or supplied, by 'L. Macartney, The Poet's Box, 184 Overgate, Dundee'.
Parodying the Ten Commandments, the writer of this light-hearted broadside informs his audience that husbands, rather than God, are the all-powerful deities that women should really be worshipping. Employing bible-like language, the writer proceeds to give ten amusing reasons why wives should unquestioningly obey their husbands. Although the writing is completely male chauvinist pig in tone, it should be noted that this broadside is part of a pair. 'The Wife's Commandments' is written from the perspective of a female chauvinist sow, and answers the husband's orders with her own decrees. The National Library of Scotland's collection contains both of these humorous broadsides.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

Although the name of the publisher is not included and the sheet is not dated, it was printed in Edinburgh and cost one penny.
This light-hearted story pokes fun at Irish visitors to Scotland, playing on the old myth that the Irish are rather slow on the uptake. The ballad tells the amusing and fantastical story of how an Irish farmer was cut to shreds by a monkey while visiting a barber's shop for a shave. It seems that the Irishman was too stupid to realise that he was being shaved by a monkey - cue ensuing confusion and chaos all round. Continuing the theme of stereotyping according to nationality, this 'shaggy monkey's tale' ends with the injured Irishman meeting another Irishman, and agreeing to go for a whisky with him to drown his sorrows.

This broadside seems to describe the events surrounding a visit to Edinburgh by Daniel O'Connell, probably in 1835 (also known as the Liberator) who had achieved Catholic Emancipation in 1829. This allowed Catholics to sit in the Westminster Parliament. O'Connell's next campaign was to press for Home Rule for Ireland. The tone of this broadside is deeply disrespectful to Catholics and Irish people, perhaps reflecting the popular mood in Edinburgh at the time. There are references to pigs, potatoes, Popery, the rack wheel and the Gilmerton carters - who had been executed in 1830 for a particularly vicious rape and murder.

A note at the foot of the sheet states that it was published by 'Angus, Printer'.
Although the headline claims that these letters were written by the two condemned men, Thomas Smith and George Stephenson, there is no factual evidence to support this claim. Both men were sentenced to death for stealing two horses from the farm of Rev. James Maitland Robertson, the Minister of Livingston, and one horse from William Glendinning of Livingston Mill. When the ultimate sentence was decreed, the prisoners fell to their knees and begged the judges and jury to recommend them for mercy. Although the penalty looks severe to a modern audience, the 'Criminal Code' (the 'Bloody Code') that existed in Scotland from 1650 to 1850 meant that property was safeguarded at all costs - hence the death sentence.

McKaen (sometimes McKeehan), was sentenced to hang for murdering James Buchanan of Lanarkshire. This entire report, however, appears to be more of a publicity stunt to generate interest in this criminal's memoirs, than to report factual information to the public. There is a list of the most horrendous but compelling crimes detailed, which McKaen denies committing but directs the reader to his book for the in-depth evidence.

This ballad offers the reader a journey through the ridiculous. Peppered with paradoxical and fantastical events, this tale would have provided entertainment for the broadside-reading public. Although light-hearted, it actually plays on people's negative attitudes towards the Irish by highlighting the stereotypical notion of Irish logic as topsy-turvy.

Earl Grey (1764-1845) was the Prime Minister responsible for the Act, which extended the right to vote to one in seven adult males. This imagined dialogue depicts two Irishmen confusing the Reform issue with another significant political movement of the time, the campaign for Irish Home Rule, and ends up with them comparing Grey unfavourably with Daniel O'Connell (1775-1847), the Home Rule campaigner.

Broadside authors tended to see themselves as moral guardians and teachers in society. As such, publishers often disseminated 'educational' texts outlining the social and personal consequences of undisciplined or immoral behaviour.

This poem includes many Masonic pointers such as references to the brethern of charity, the cornerstone of Christ, and pillars and temples. There are a few other poems held in the National Library of Scotland's collection which were written on Masonic topics, and one or two of them even describe Masonic ceremonies.

It was published by Menzies of Edinburgh, in 1834.
The phrase 'sister-german', rarely used nowadays, means 'full sister' rather than 'half sister' or 'step sister'. It is perhaps included in this broadside because it was the legal term used at the trial and much of the broadside seems to be a direct transcription of the court proceedings. It was probably necessary for the court to make this distinction, to specify the degree of seriousness of the crime. The difference in sentences passed reflects the tendency of the Establishment in nineteenth-century Scotland to blame all crimes of a sexual nature principally on the female participant. This prejudice is evident in many other crime broadsides.

The song begins: 'WHEN Adam first was plac'd in Paradice, / His Spouse he mist, tho' other Happiness / Did so abound, over all Creatures he.'
An epithalamium is a song or poem celebrating a marriage. This particular one marks the nuptials of James, 5th Earl of Wemyss and Janet Charteris, who married in Edinburgh on the 17th September, 1720. The marriage of such high-profile figures would have sparked a large amount of interest amongst the public. In response to this, broadside producers issued epithalamiums or marriage songs; whether they were commissioned is unclear. The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection includes an interesting selection of epithalamiums.

It was published by T. Duncan of the Saltmarket, Glasgow, and probably sold for one penny.
This broadside provides the reader with a witty account of the celebrations following Ritchie and Murphy's wedding. Not only is the author of this account highly amused by the advanced ages of the newly-weds, and their reasons for postponing the wedding, he also bears witness to a spectacular drunken brawl and provides a list of 'blue Eyes, bloody Noses, scratched Faces, and damaged Wigs'. This highly amusing and tongue-in-cheek account would probably have sold extremely well, if for no other reason than its sheer entertainment value.

Unfortunately, no publication details have been included, although handwritten at the top of the sheet is the date, '20 March, 1825'.
Broadsides regarding such unlikely unions appear to have been extremely popular and elicited much humour. The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection includes many such accounts. In some cases, the marriage is between a rather pretty young woman and a decrepit old man. Here, however, the tables have been turned and it is a rather dashing young man wishing to wed a much older woman. It soon becomes apparent that the young man has abandoned his bride at the alter and run off with the funds he was given to clothe himself for the occasion. Highly formulaic and very possibly invented for sheer entertainment value, it nevertheless appears rather heartless to describe this poor woman's predicament as 'Funny and Laughable'.

It was printed by W. Boag of Newcastle, and probably sold for one penny.
This rather disturbing incident must have sparked considerable interest for it to be picked up by a Newcastle publisher. In most instances, local events were largely reported by local publishers. It is reassuring that people at the time, in particular women, were shocked and outraged by these events and attempted to halt the proceedings. As Mary MacKintosh would have known only too well, a woman who entered into marriage at this time automatically became the property of her husband.

A brief verse then appears, followed by a list of resolutions. It was printed by Menzies of the Lawnmarket, Edinburgh, and probably sold for one penny.
Although the introduction to this document suggests a rather serious subject matter, it quickly descends into farce. Possibly in reaction to the Reform Bills of the nineteenth century, which were not considered far-reaching enough by a large proportion of the population, the author of this piece calls on the Reformed Members to consider his list of resolutions. The first proposal suggests the formation of 'henpecked societies' for all men who find themselves mistreated by their 'hard-hearted wives'. The remaining ten proposals are equally as humorous.

Although there are other sheets covering this story in the National Library of Scotland's collection, none of them cover the trial and sentencing of William Ainslie. He was executed for high treason involving the sum of £50. Further information on this case, which would have been most interesting, is simply unavailable from broadsides.

His fellow sufferers said nothing, and all behaved with great decorum, and resignation to their fate.' The report is signed by someone called 'Pelham', and was published by J. Galbraith of Glasgow.
The leader of a gang of Irish rebels, Edward Marcus Despard was executed in Southwark, London, on the 21st of February, 1803, for committing the crime of High Treason. Although the writer goes into great details regarding Despard's last words, unfortunately, he does not tell his audience what in fact Despard did to deserve this terrible punishment. A colonel in the army, it appears that Despard planned to instigate a revolution, by means of hi-jacking mail coaches. At a time when Britain was fighting in the Napoleonic Wars, any disloyal acts were treated with the utmost severity.

The speech begins: ' My Friends, THE present Age is so degenerate into Vice and Immorality, That they have the Ascendant over Godliness and Vertue; whereas Religion and Piety are run down by manifest Profanity, Dissimulation and Hypocrisy'.
As a coal-bearer in the eighteenth century, Margaret Millar is likely to have had little education, and the ornate style of this speech suggests that she had little creative input into her own published last words. This was quite common for the period. Last speeches were a popular subject for broadsides, and broadside authors were practised in making them appealing and affecting to readers. The emotions of guilt and repentance expressed here, while probably genuinely felt by the condemned woman, were also recurring, standard features of this type of broadside report.

It was published in 1719 by Robert Brown of Edinburgh.
The 'last speeches' of condemned criminals were popular subjects for broadside publishers, as well as allowing the subjects some opportunity to make their peace with the world and with God. The speeches were often formulaic and were probably drafted by anonymous scribes. The amount of actual input from the subjects seems to have varied. This example balances specific biographical and case details with standard expressions of contrition and repentance. The facts and sentiments may well have been Neil Cordey's own, but were probably interpreted by an experienced author sensitive to public tastes.

At Adincraw, in the Shire of Berwick.' Tincklar's speech begins: ' I AM brought here this Day to suffer, for the horrid and and Unnatural Murder of my fellow Creature.' There is an old Scots word 'tinclarian' meaning 'tinker-like', so 'Tincklar' in this context may be an alternative Scots word for 'tinker'.
Often the 'Last Speeches' published as broadsides were formulaic expressions of repentance that were probably written by anonymous authors and had little input from the condemned person. In this case, however, very specific details of James Thomson Tincklar's life are included, as is a graphic and disturbing description of the crime of which he was convicted. This suggests that while Tincklar may not have committed the speech to paper himself, it is likely he dictated most of the details to a scribe. Tincklar blames his crime on his wife's wicked influence. Such misogynistic defences were commonplace in criminal trials of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Society's attitude to both illegitimate pregnancies and abortion are clearly expressed in this text, with most of the ultimate responsibility lying with the woman involved. Anderson's 'downfall' is linked with her education and her decision not to place herself under parental authority and advice. The father of the child and his father are both publicly named here, highlighting the very public nature of eighteenth-century atonement.

The speech is 'signed' by John Andouin and was reprinted in Edinburgh in 1728.
There are no further details available on Andouin's crime or his life, but this is not unusual as eighteenth-century execution notices were not published as entertainment but rather as a warning about imperilling your immortal soul. It is curious to note that the text of this sheet is addressed to the crowd, suggesting that the seller or patterer would have moved among the spectators as the action was unfolding.
Capital punishment has become a hotly debated issue during the twentieth century and no doubt will continue to be so. It is, however, interesting to note that certain precautions are taken here.

This broadside reports the confessions and last words of the horse stealers, John Smith and George Stevenson. Both confessions identify their abandonment of God as the original cause of all their woe, highlighting the belief prevalent at the time that an absence of religion equated with immoral and illegal behaviour. Although the theft of horses might not seem that heinous an offence, the 'Bloody Code' (known as the 'Criminal Code' in Scotland) introduced in 1660 was designed to protect property above all else, hence the execution of these two unfortunates.

Previously it is to be assumed that it was sold according to the type of cut. The women are portrayed as a drunken lot, and the main thing they are worried about is that the new law is losing them drinking money!
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing.

This humorous song deals with the subject of drinking tea. It is sent out as a warning to all husbands, advising them not to interfere with the tea-drinking habits of their wives. If they refuse to take heed of this warning, the song lays testament to what can happen. In another broadside in the National Library of Scotland's collection, entitled 'A Lecture to the Ladies by a Disobliged Admirer of the Fair Sex', it is suggested that contemporary women have replaced the 'forbidden apple' with the habit of drinking tea.

This sheet was published by Sanderson of Edinburgh. There are two woodcuts of ugly and menacing caricatured women servants, included above the title. Along the top of the sheet, someone has hand-written '9th March 1840'.
There was a trend during the mid-nineteenth century for workers trying to better their conditions, the servants' strand of which was reflected in literature of the time. The author of this text is attempting to make fun of maid servants' aspirations to better wages and standards of living, and their attempts to gain respect for both themselves and their careers. This is done mainly by drawing attention to the perks of the job and the stereotypes associated with female servants.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts - the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate.

Habbie Simpson was the piper of Kilbarchan, a village west of Paisley, during the late sixteenth century. Robert Sempill of Beltrees, Renfrewshire (c.1595-1659), wrote an eulogy of him, copies of which are also contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection. This reveals that Simpson was brave, good at football, a bit of a gossip and renowned for his humorous behaviour! It also clearly states Simpson's reputation as a piper, which is now celebrated by a statue in the town centre.

This broadside is a precursor to today's joke books. The 'humours of the age' contained on the broadside tend to be one-liners rather than shaggy-dog stories. The little piece of doggerel verse that ends the sheet is a relic of an earlier age of public performance, when playwrights and poets sometimes ended their works with a final verse thanking the audience for its attention and craving that its appreciation be shown in donations of gold and silver. The presence of the verse here suggests that the broadside might have been a transcription of one contemporary entertainer's performance.

This is a mock-advertisement printed on a broadside for comic purposes. Wordplay is the key to the humour. A common phrase, such as 'turn', referring to a performance or an act, is made into 'stomach-turn' and takes on a whole new meaning. The fictional performers are given comic-sounding rhyming names such as 'Runco M'Bunko' and 'Dugald M'Google'. The date is given as the 'Forty-Tooth'.

The story is mysteriously signed with the initials of the author, 'W.S.'
This light-hearted story is cleverly constructed around the titles of well-known Scottish folk songs. The writer personifies the songs, and brings them together for a grand meeting or 'symposium'. Although it is obviously easier to do this when the title itself is a person's name, the writer cleverly tailors the more awkward titles to fit in with the narrative. The ending to the story is rather surreal, with all the song titles singing 'Auld Lang Syne' - who is also an attendee at this most bizarre of gatherings!

A note underneath the introduction states that the story was sourced from 'The Glasgow Courier' of Saturday, 10th of May, 1823.
As suggested by the fictional names of the protagonists, this story was written to entertain its audience, although it could be that the writer also wanted to impart a moral message, too. The issue that lies at the centre of the controversial court case that resulted from this stolen kiss, is to determine just how much a kiss is worth, then to award damages accordingly. To answer this fascinating question, the lawyers call a number of impressive witnesses, including a political economist. After twelve hours of careful deliberation, the jury decided to accept the defendant's argument, who stated that he had not stolen the kiss, but had merely borrowed it, and would soon be returning it to its rightful owner.

This is clearly a parody of the traditional stump speech. Stump speech is another name for a campaign speech, usually political, which covers a large number of non-specific points. It is so called because those delivering the speech would traditionally use a tree stump as a raised platform.

Primarily publishers and distributors, they not only printed the standard range of broadsides, but also accepted commissions and offered a cheap publishing service to impecunious writers. The National Library of Scotland's collection includes a large number of broadsides published by the Poet's Box.",Broadside featuring 'A Stump Speech' and 'Cure for a Cripple',1880-1900
15949,humour,L.C.1268,"This amusing broadside is in fact a parody of a surgeon's bill, as illustrated by the ridiculous services that the doctor has performed on his - hopefully - fictitious patient. Although the broadside is not dated, the bill itself was apparently written on the 30th of May, 1830. A note at the foot of the sheet states it was published by W. Sanderson, whose premises were located in Edinburgh.
Clearly, the playful content that makes up this broadside was written solely to entertain its audience. The sheet starts off with a light-hearted satire on a doctor's bill - although the prices might not be satirical, since it totals just under £50 (about £2600 in today's terms). Following this bright opening, the writer amuses us further with a list of items that will be available for purchase at an auction. Madly, however, if any readers should wish to buy such chimeric products as a glass wheel barrow or a mahogany poker, then they must make their enquiries to the auctioneer, William Neversell, two days after the sale has finished!

The sheet was published by John Muir of Princes Street, Glasgow.
This broadside is concerned with legally identifying the rights of way for a footpath that ran alongside the River Clyde. Rather than being settled locally, however, the court case to determine this issue ended up being decided in the House of Lords. The House of Lords eventually ruled in favour of the people's walking rights, hence the shouts of 'HUZZA!' at the end of the sheet.

Although no date of publication is included, the sheet was printed by John Sanderson of Edinburgh. There is a similar broadside entitled, 'New Intended Act of Parliament', that is also included in this collection.
As illustrated by the satirical nature of the woodcut, this amusing broadside is actually a parody of legislation passed by the government. This people's act contains 13 new laws, with each one being the sort of law that would make an audience laugh. For instance, law number five states that no old maid, wife or widow woman should take more than one pound on snuff in a week. Then to balance out the gender divide, law number eight states that if a husband comes home drunk, then the wife is entitled to pick his pockets while putting him to bed. Given the impertinent tone of these laws, it could be argued that this sheet is quite subversive towards Parliament.

The reference to William IV dates this broadside to between 1830 and 1837.
The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection includes several other sheets detailing this 'new intended Act of Parliament'. Whilst the coat of arms gives the list of resolutions an air of formality, upon closer inspection the humour becomes apparent. The resolutions are in fact light-hearted nonsense that would have proved entertaining reading to the audience of the day.

Although written in the verbose style of parliamentary legislation, this light-hearted broadside is in fact a parody of the acts passed by the government. This people's bill proposes fifteen new acts to be passed, with each one being the sort of act that would add to the general gaiety of the nation. For instance, act number four proposes that working men should be allowed to smoke when making their way home, while number nine states that, for fire reasons, it should be illegal for two people living in the same house to get drunk at the same time.

Here young scholars and poets could have their work published quickly and cheaply, but also often anonymously, as with this example. This text, however, perhaps contradicts the idea that surreal and slapstick humour only became popular after World War II.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

A note at the foot of the sheet states that this letter was written or published on the 1st of May, 1822. The letter is signed with the initials, 'W.W.'. 'Auld Reekie' is an old nickname for Edinburgh.
This rather strange letter claims to be a descriptive account of a man's journey in the north of Scotland - most likely the Highlands. After politely telling the recipient of the letter, 'Geordie', how much he missed his friend's company during the journey, the writer then proceeds to describe his journey and the people that he met during it. It appears likely, however, that this letter is a work of humorous fiction, since much of it is composed of the titles to well-known Scottish folk songs. Thus, the letter reads much like a listing of folk songs, with the exception that the titles to these songs have been woven into a narrative. Clearly, this letter was written to entertain its audience and to flaunt the letter-writer's skill in constructing a narrative.

The broadside was published by James Brydone of 17 South Hanover Street, Edinburgh.
This would appear to be an advertisement for an evening of entertainment hosted by 'Lord Nicholson'. The main text of the broadside is a piece attributed to the 'Liverpool Chronicle', comparing Nicholson to Lord Brougham (1778-1868), the Edinburgh lawyer, founder of the 'Edinburgh Review' and reforming Whig politician. The comparison appears to be ironic, gently satirising Brougham while exaggerating Nicholson's qualities. Nicholson is less famous, but he seems to have been the Chief Baron of the Judge and Jury Society, and editor of the 'Illustrated London Life Weekly', who was also known for holding social gatherings.

The handwritten note is most likely referring to the Scottish writer, Alexander Pennecuik (d. 1730), who is not to be confused with his uncle, Dr Alexander Pennecuik (1652-1722). Dr Pennicuik was also known for his verse and, in particular, his wit. This poem deals in a light-hearted way with the outmoded belief that all women are somehow tainted by the misdeeds of Eve. It is suggested that contemporary women have substituted the 'forbidden apple' with the demon drink, in this case tea! What then follows is a list of perceived evils attributed to the drinking of tea. Although playful in tone, this poem inadvertently highlights the negative and highly prejudicial attitudes towards women in eighteenth-century society.

This broadside was definitely not written by a Welshman, for it is very derogatory. Written in the person of 'Evan Morgan', a typically Welsh name, the will is a catalogue of humourous incongruities and impossibilities. For example, he bequeaths Thom 'Two woolen Eel-skins', and 'Two pair of Wooden Scizzars', and the will was apparently witnessed by 'twenty Goates'. It is unusual to see the Welsh parodied in this way, as most commonly in broadsides this type of humour is directed against the Irish.

At first glance, this broadside appears to carry an advertisement for a recital at Major Weir's House in Edinburgh's West Bow. Upon closer inspection, however, it soon becomes clear that this notice is in fact parodying such advertisements. The normally impressive names of classical musicians and the wonderful titles given to their music are made a mockery of here: 'And a SONG by Signiora SHRIL-PIPE called the IRISH HOUL'. By indirectly poking fun at the inherent snobbery often found in such circles, the author of this advertisement has produced a highly amusing work.

Allan Ramsay (1686-1758), poet, song-collector and Edinburgh wig-maker, is today recognised (with Robert Fergusson and Robert Burns) as one of the great vernacular Scots poets of the eighteenth century, and as a vital figure in the revival of Scots poetry after the Reformation of 1560. Even in his lifetime Ramsay was an acclaimed and successful writer, yet this poem attacks him for his intention to translate Horace. Translation of classical poetry was, in fact, a common task undertaken by eighteenth-century poets, and the influences of Horace and Virgil are clear in much of Ramsay's poetry.
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites.

No publication details have been included on this sheet.
The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection also includes the broadside which preceded this one. It details the initial attack on the keeper by the horde of wild beasts. Whilst both appear to recount a rather strange zoological encounter, in reality they offer an insight into the political posturing that was going on in Edinburgh, and the rest of the country, at this time - most probably the mid-nineteenth century. The Royal Edinburgh Zoological Gardens opened in 1839 and closed in 1857 after running into difficulties.

This sheet, in quite a short and concise way, addresses many major political and economic issues which dominated Scottish society during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is difficult to know whether the author is pro-Scottish, anti-independence and pro-unionist, or even pro-monarchist. Jacobites, Newcastle coal, the variations in Scottish and English measures and the justice system are all touched upon in this intriguing narrative. The note the author ends on, however, would suggest that he is a member of one of the reforming movements, as all his points seem to be a criticism of the aristocracy.

The Writers to the Signet, are an organization of solicitors that originated from the 15th-century Keepers of the King's Seal, or signet. Although no publication date has been provided on this broadside, it is known that William Smith was resident at 3 Bristo Port between the years 1824 and 1829. It seems likely, therefore, that this sheet was published around that time. Smith's first publication, of which he was also the author, appeared in 1822 and was entitled 'First lessons in teaching a child to read and spell English'. He went on to produce a large number of humorous and instructional broadsides and chapbooks, some of which are also contained in the National Library of Scotland's broadside collection.

This story was sourced from the 'Edinburgh Weekly Chronicle' on Wednesday 5th May, 1824.
This broadside relates to the feud between two landowners, one of whom wants to continue his road onto the other's land. The text, however, does not name the landowners or the area where this feud occurred. Instead the author makes fun of the landowners' endeavours - calling them generals and their staff 'an army'. Battle and strategy terminology are also used while references are made to Scotland's, then defunct, social system of clanship.
Road building in Scotland became increasingly important during the nineteenth century. This often caused problems between landowners who were not always in accordance with one another. This situation was exacerbated as many of the Jacobite attained lands were returned to their original holders during the 1820s, 30s and 40s.",Broadside entitled 'Desperate Engagement',1824

The letter is dated the 12th of October, 1821, and, rather bizarrely, is signed by the steeple bell of Paisley High Kirk. The sheet was published by John Muir of Glasgow.
This surreal story, allegedly written by a steeple bell in Paisley, is addressed to one of its friends, a steeple in Glasgow. Clearly, this light-hearted broadside is not intended to be taken seriously, and the author was merely trying to amuse his audience with a playful fancy. Written in a colloquial Scots dialect, the steeple bell is suffering from Bells Palsy (or 'dumb palsy' - a type of facial paralysis) and, in an effort to cure the bell of this affliction, the minister called a doctor to give the bell a medical check-up. In short, this whole story is structured around the punning possibilities of the term, Bell's Palsy.

It was published by William Cameron, probably in Edinburgh, and priced at one penny.
William Cameron, known as 'Hawkie', (c.1790-1851) was a well-known speech crier who published broadsides in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Paisley in the first half of the nineteenth century. The broadside shown here is one of several mock crime reports, apparently composed by Cameron, which feature a diarist named 'Janet Clinker'. Others also feature 'Humphrey Clinker', a character Cameron seems to have borrowed from the eighteenth century Scottish novelist Tobias Smollett (1721-71). Like Smollett, Cameron gives his characters typifying names, such as 'Lord Justice Reason' or 'Mr Common Sense', which alert the reader to the fact that these are pieces of fictional writing, intended for comic or satirical purposes.
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers. Crimes could generate sequences of sheets covering descriptive accounts, court proceedings, last words, lamentations and executions as they occurred.

The sheet was published by Forbes & Co. of the Cowgate, Edinburgh. Although no date of publication is printed on the sheet, a hand-written note suggests it was published on, or around, the 18th of June, 1834.
Although the sensational headline to this broadside suggests that the story is about Daniel O'Connell (1775-1847), it is in fact about an escaped circus lion which shared the same name as the famous Irish agitator. The writer proceeds to describe the humorous antics that took place during the capturing of this lion, before the keepers succeeded in returning it to its cage. The tone of this story is very much that of a 'shaggy dog's tale' - or rather a 'shaggy lion's tale. After finishing the lion story, the writer mundanely concludes the broadside with a quick round-up of recent court cases.

This broadside would have been highly topical in its day and is written in the form of an argument. Tom is a cynical and snobbish Tory, who believes the Catholic Irish have gained much in recent years, such as emancipation and reform, and thus should complain no more.

Tom and Jerry became common names for Whigs and Torys after characters in Pierce Egan's (1772-1849), 'Life in London; or the Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn Esq. and Corinthian Tom' (c.1820). The mention of a meeting in London on February 4th suggests this broadside was published in 1839, when O'Connell attended the General Convention of the London Working Men's Association. The Corn Laws were eventually repealed in 1846, just as the Irish famine began.

It was published in Perth on 12th November 1795.
The early life of Donald McCraw, described here, follows a pattern that was increasingly common in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Scotland. In order to make a living, McCraw had to leave his native Highlands and travel to Glasgow to find work as a weaver. The industrial revolution, firstly in the textiles sector, then later in iron and shipbuilding, saw the population of central lowland Scotland increase dramatically, largely due to migration from the Highlands and Ireland. For many migrants, working and living conditions were harsh, but McCraw does not blame this for the circumstances that caused him to murder his wife, attributing his crime to an 'overbearing temper'.

This sheet stops mid-sentence suggesting there was more of the speech on another sheet.
Janet Hutchie confessed to the desire to kill her illegitimate child, although she claims it died very soon after being born, and then hiding the body in her trunk. This is an enlightening glimpse into the moral attitudes of the 1720s. Original sin, apportionment of guilt and divine judgement are all touched on. Some society attitudes are also revealed - the child is never named nor a sex given; Janet talks about virtue, married relations and abortion.

This was a famous case at the time and the broadsides reporting it turned into a series to try and keep up with events. There are also many sheets covering each stage of the event but there are few printer's names attached. Robert Irvine was tutor to the two boys and was convicted of murdering them, whilst out on a picnic. Most of the sordid details are covered by the various sheets - compelling entertainment.

Collins had been drinking heavily and ended up in an altercation with Panton, keeper of Glasgow's house of correction or Bridewell. Collins ran him through with his bayonet and paid for his rashness with his life. His remains were sent for dissection. It is interesting to note that up until the Anatomy Act was passed in 1832, the only bodies surgeons were legally allowed to dissect were those of executed murderers. It was seen as the ultimate humiliation of the criminal.

The speech is signed by Robert Stewart himself.
This broadside tells the tragic tale of the terrible fate that befell Robert Stewart, aged 20, who was executed for carrying out a robbery and housebreaking. Apparently written by Stewart himself, he tells of his tragic fall from grace, and thanks the magistrates 'for their attention and convenience'. From 1650 to 1840, the 'Criminal Code' (called the 'Bloody Code' in England) was applied in Scotland, and this law meant that property was defended at all costs - hence the ultimate sentence on Stewart. Stewart concludes his speech by stating that he dies in peace, and warns other young men not to stray from the path of righteousness.

The story of Elizabeth Warriner and her execution in Lincoln for the grisly murder of her 12 year old stepson, J. Warriner, must have sparked a lot of interest for it to be picked up by a Glasgow publisher. Generally broadside producers specialised in publishing local news and reports for the local market.

Treplecock's crime is given very little emphasis. His bad habits, however, are expounded upon as they are the path to sin and the devil.

Peter McLean was executed in Linlithgow on the 2nd February, 1857, for the murder of Thomas Maxwell on the road between Bathgate and Durhamtown, West Lothian.

It was published by James MacLean, probably of Glasgow, in 1823, and priced at one penny.
This address to prisoners has a morally didactic tone. It warns in particular against drunkenness, and also against 'whoring, stealing and swearing', exhorting the audience instead to observe the Sabbath and pray to God 'night and day'. The idea that this sermon was written by a man facing death for his sins gives it added urgency. However, the eloquence and biblical register of the language used indicate that Robert Scott did not actually write it.

Hutton appears to have been involved in the robbery and then murder of her master and mistress with others: the language, however, is fairly convoluted and her crime is not the topic of this text.

Part of a long sequence of broadsides dedicated to a murder that occurred near Gilmerton in 1830, this sheet includes a letter apparently written by Dobie to his wife, followed by a joint lamentation and confession to the public that the two prisoners seemingly wrote. While Dobie's simple and touching letter to his wife reads true, the verbose and exaggerated literary style of the joint lamentation is not perhaps the tone of writing one would normally associate with lowly carters, and contrasts sharply with the reported spoken words of the two men.

He survived due to charity and strong role models but eventually he fell into bad habits. He fathered an illegitimate child and was called to atone before his parish.

The court case of William Scott and his brother, John, was highly unusual in its outcome - totally bizarre, in fact. The brothers were up before Sheriff Depute William Honeyman in Glasgow on three charges of theft by housebreaking.

The 'last speeches' of condemned criminals were quite commonly reproduced on broadsides, but it is unlikely that many were published verbatim. Rather, they were probably written by anonymous broadside journalists, based on an amalgamation of facts that had emerged at the subject's trial, confessions or comments that the prisoner had made to visiting ministers after the trial, and a few stock sentiments of contrition, repentance and warning. Ann Morison's 'last words' very much follow the standard for this sort of broadside, beginning with a brief personal history, continuing with an admission of guilt and pleas for God's forgiveness, and culminating with lengthy warnings to other potential sinners.

The life of John McMillan, as allegedly recounted by himself, was a very colourful one. He began working life as a cattle-herd in his native Highlands, then served in the Queen's Highlanders and Scots Fusilers, before studying at Chelsea college in London. He then returned to Glasgow, and several years later committed murder on Alexander Moodie after an argument over an outstanding bill. His flight from justice involved returning to the Highlands and London, before his eventual capture in Edinburgh.
'Dying words' were a popular topic for broadsides, and in many cases, especially in later broadsides, they followed such a standard formula that the suspicion lingers over whether the subject actually had any input into them. In this example, the amount of biographical detail included suggests that John McMillan was involved in the composition of his last words, although it is likely that they were dictated to a scribe.","Broadside entitled 'The last speech, confession and dying words'",1798

This broadside parodies the last speeches that were often uttered by people before their execution. It is written as if from the point of view of the 'Cross of Edinburgh', more commonly known as the Mercat Cross, and offers an interesting insight into the events that occurred in its vicinity. The Mercat Cross is situated close to St Giles Cathedral and was traditionally the chosen location for public announcements, gatherings and executions. Although it was removed in 1756 and taken to Drum House, Prime Minister Gladstone (1809-1898), who was also the MP for Midlothian, was instrumental in returning the Cross to its original location in 1885.

The sheet is written from the perspective of a female chauvinist sow, and warns errant husbands that wives, rather than God, are the all-powerful deities that men should really be worshipping. In addition to legislating against her husband forming even platonic friendships with other women, the wife also states that the husband must do all the housework on Sundays, as the wife labours so hard on the other six days.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

She was seized with the pains of child-birth, while playing at her piano . . .' The report was sourced from the Inverness Courier of December 1836.
Just as stories of incest and abuse fill today's press, they made popular reading in the nineteenth century, too. This story is all the more shocking because it concerns a clergyman and his sister. The poor woman ran away with her baby, after her brother had confessed his part in its conception. She was apprehended yet escaped a second time. The author of the piece, kindly, hopes that they will 'elude detection'.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative.

The name of the publisher is not included, though it was printed in Edinburgh and cost one penny.
This broadside tells the tragic story of Margaret Kennedy, who was sentenced to death in 1818 for tendering counterfeit banknotes. The evidence against the poor woman was overwhelming, as a number of Glasgow shopkeepers appeared as witnesses to identify her as having purchased groceries in their shops with the forged notes. In mitigation, the defence pointed out that she was a young widow of no education who had become homeless following her husband?s death, and the jury recommended her to mercy. The judge, however, sentenced her to death.

A handwritten note under the title suggests that John Curry's 'lug' was nailed to the Tron for forging banknotes.
Unlikely to have been written by John Curry himself, this light-hearted and witty 'speech' has been cleverly constructed to give a clear impression of Curry's own self-importance: 'Surrounded, by my body Guards, / I'm far above, the rank of Lairds'. There are a number of other broadsides contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection that relate to the case of John Curry, including a last speech, and a dialogue between John Curry and Tonny Ashton, who were imprisoned together. Tony, or Tonny,  Aston or Ashton, was a strolling player who came to Edinburgh in the 1720s. He was promoted by the poet Allan Ramsay who wrote prologues for Aston?s performances as well as selling tickets for his plays. In 1726 Aston was denied a licence to perform by the Master of the Revels as he had failed to pay to the Revels office, the dues he owed them. Nevertheless he continued to perform until Skinner?s Hall (where he performed) was shut down. After a spell of litigation, Aston cut his losses and left Edinburgh in 1728.

Morrison of East Campbell's Close in Edinburgh's Cowgate, and republished in Glasgow by J. Galbraith.
This crime broadside describes the tragic fate that befell Samuel Bell, after he was found guilty of forging banknotes. The writer focuses attention on the social dimension of Bell's tragedy, by considering the effects that his death will have on his pregnant wife and parents. It seems that Bell conducted himself with the utmost dignity during his period in the condemned cell. However, it also seems that Bell's model behaviour was related to his hope of having his sentence mitigated. Bell was attended to by the Rev. Dickson, who heard his confession and helped him in his prayer to God for mercy in the next world.

These broadside verses tell the tragic story of Mrs McLeod, who was executed in Edinburgh in 1727, for the crime of forgery. The first part of the ballad describes her early life, ending with the charge of forgery. In part two of the ballad, Mrs McLeod protests her innocence and warns that those who did her wrong will suffer come Judgement Day. While being sentenced to death for forgery might seem harsh to a modern audience, the severity of the 'Bloody Code' (known as the 'Criminal Code' in Scotland) meant that executions for such offences were commonplace.

Thomas and his son David, who was thought to be about 16, were charged with stealing, falsehood and forgery. Over a period of three years they had been stealing the notes and gold contained in the mail, which Thomas supervised. Thomas denied the accusations but David pled guilty. Despite this both men, after examination, were found guilty and sentenced to hang. This may seem severe, but the law in Scotland at this time placed more emphasis on protecting property than anything else. It is not known if the sentence was carried out.

Although Joseph Richardson's brother, William, was also convicted for the same crime, he was granted a reprieve following a petition 'sent up to the fountain of mercy in favour of these unhappy men'. John M'Canna (also spelt McKana or McKena) and Joseph, however, were granted no such reprieve. It is said that the Richardson brothers were from a respectable family and, prior to their unfortunate meeting with McCanna, were beyond reproach. McCanna was a 39 year old Irish emigrant. He married a Lockerbie woman and worked as a roadman. The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection includes at least one other broadside detailing the execution of the two men.

The name of the publisher is not included on this broadside.
This broadside tells the unhappy tale of Margaret Cunningham, who was executed in 1807 for poisoning her husband. As she was pregnant at the time of her trial in Perth in May 1806, sentence was postponed and an interlocution announced. This reprieve was merely temporary, however, and she was sentenced to death in November 1806. After describing her good upbringing and mentioning that much of the blame for her tragic predicament lay with her secret lover, John Skinner, the sheet concludes with a hellfire warning to others that there is no hiding place from God.

A woodcut illustration of a woman surrounded by foliage has been included at the top of this sheet.
Although it appears from this broadside that these were the last words of Mrs McLeoid, it is very unlikely that she actually wrote them. The National Library of Scotland's broadside collection contains many examples of 'genuine' last speeches and lamentations, in which the criminal prays for salvation and issues a warning to all those tempted to travel down the same path. In reality, the vast majority of these highly formulaic and sermonising speeches were created by the broadside producers themselves.

The National Library of Scotland's collection also includes a broadside detailing Dempster's slate-hammer attack on George McDonald. It was issued while McDonald, although severly injured from the assault, was still alive. By the time the broadside shown here was printed, however, McDonald was already dead. It was common for a crime to be reported over several broadsides. The first usually dealt with the crime itself, with subsequent sheets detailing the apprehension of the criminal, a confession or trial, the execution and, finally, a last speech.

The midwife, Simpson, it is recounted, died on Tuesday 27th July, 1841. This broadside was printed by Saunders.
Simpson, dying in the greatest of agonies to atone for her crimes, supposedly confessed to up to 20 instances of child-murder and infanticide. She had worked as a successful midwife in and around Falkirk and was believed to have been of a 'sanctimonious' disposition. Midwives, however, were mainly treated with suspicion by most sections of the community, despite the fact that many women relied on their discretion, skills and knowledge. Although outrage is displayed here, in an age without contraceptives or legal access to terminations, infanticide was a common occurrence.

No further dates are given and there is no publisher's name included.
This narrative is very revealing about the Scotland John Halden lived in. John travels from Hamilton across the country to Edinburgh looking for work because of poverty. He then calls at the Duke of Hamilton's residence expecting patronage. He calls at the back door for scraps and he is met by the Earl of Rutherglen's coachman and the butler, who bangs Halden's head of a column. Surgeon's eventually donate their services and when Halden is pronounced dead they saw his head open - presumably because there was no family to protect the body.

This factual account detailing the stabbing of Margaret Thompson by John Con after he had argued with his wife, is used as an opportunity to moralise on the consequences of rash and hot-headed actions. At this point John Con had been taken into custody but nothing further had unfolded. It was usual for cases to be printed in instalments to keep the audience up to date with all the latest happenings.

Although this story covers the details, confession and arrest of Robert Dempster for the murder of the man, McDonald, there are many more social details revealed by this text. The drinking habits and movements of the working class in 1830s Scotland are touched on as well as their social interaction. The text refers to one English speaking and  one non-English speaking drover, highlighting the prevalence of Gaelic in Scottish society and its acceptance. Finally Dempster had plans to escape to America, so a fresh start and the option of travelling to America were well known by all levels of society.

The National Library of Scotland holds several broadsides featuring this case, and if the claims that they killed up to eleven people are true, it is quite surprising that Stewart and his accomplice Catherine Wright do not remain more notorious today.

Moffat's eventual arrest took place on the 7th October 1825 in Auchinearn. At the time, he was working as a weaver under the alias of George Watson. As with most crime broadsides, this one ends with a moral lesson for the readership.

He returned one evening for more money, but when refused, killed Geddes, his brother-in-law, with a pair of fire tongs. The text reveals Bryce's plans for escape and his state of mind.

This peculiar broadside, published in 1820, sensationally claims to answer the riddle of an unsolved murder and robbery from 1806. The sum taken in this robbery was £5,000, which would be worth around £206,000 today. The circumstantial evidence provided in the broadside appears less than conclusive, however, and is based on retrospective gossip from the underworld.

The broadside carries no publication details.
The murder described in this report is one of particular cruelty. John Henderson, a bigamist with a history of cruelty to both his lawful and his unlawful wives, allegedly killed Mary Grier with his bare hands when she was far advanced in pregnancy. Broadsides were frequently misogynistic, and implied that wives provoked their violent husbands, but in this case the broadside author is wholly sympathetic to the victim, and condemns John Henderson.

The sheet was published in 1825 by John Muir of Glasgow.
With its reference to Shakespeare's 'green-eyed monster' of jealousy (quoted from the play, 'Othello'), this broadside reports a terrible murder that occurred when an older man killed his young sweetheart during a jealous rage. Though originally lovers and co-habitees, Sarah McViccar and Charles Campbell had parted following an argument. Campbell must have been obsessed with his former sweetheart, however, for after seeing her sitting on the knee of a supposed rival in a public house, he abruptly left the room, only to return later to plunge a knife into the girl's throat. Given the dominant theme of an older man trying to control the behaviour of a younger woman, the parallel with Othello seems particularly apt.

This eighteenth-century crime report is written in a more formal and verbose style than many of the later, more sensationalist broadside reports that foreshadow today's tabloid newspapers. The case itself is a relatively unremarkable one, of a man robbed and then murdered after an argument with the alleged thief. These simple facts are framed by a long discourse on the moral decline of the country, in which the author quotes at length from the Bible.

The author, however, suspects that the root cause of the argument was alcohol, and uses the early part of the report as an opportunity to preach about the dangers of drinking to excess among the lower classes.

The sheet was published on, or around, the 20th of March, 1834, by Forbes & Co. of the Cowgate, Edinburgh.
This broadside contains two suspected crime stories, both of which describe how two women allegedly murdered their husbands. The first story tells of the murder of an Edinburgh landlord, Thomas Turner, whose tempestuous relationship with his wife is used to imply that Mrs Turner and her boyfriend are the culprits. While the opening story is presented as a crime of passion, the second story describes what seems to be a more calculated killing. In this story, the writer tells of how a middle-aged husband living in Blackburn, Lothian, was poisoned by his much younger wife. Cold-hearted quotes allegedly uttered by the murderess are employed to liven up this second story.

There are no further details attached to this sheet.
A group of men meeting in Shotts, to talk about government reform, were 'accidentally' side-tracked into talking about overthrowing the government. At this point the ghost of Rochefoucault appeared, with the warning that overthrowing the establishment simply created unstable chaos. This probably refers to the French author and moralist François La Rochefoucauld (1613-1680).
This style of text, with its implicit political propaganda, would not only have made for compelling entertainment, but would also perhaps have stimulated political thought, reasoning and debate.","Broadside regarding an apparition which appeared at Shotts, Lanarkshire, Scotland",1790-1810

' The sheet was published by William Carse, who is listed as working from various addresses in Glasgow between 1820 and 1836.
With no names or dates regarding the 'crime' mentioned on this sheet, it could just be that this broadside is a work of fiction written to satisfy the morbid imagination of the public. However, since the public is generally fascinated by dark events, the chapmen probably had no difficulty in selling it to the public. At the start of the second part of the sheet, the place where this terrible event took place is named as Smolensko. This could be a reference to the town of Smolensk, in Russia. It appears, therefore, that this report might be based on happenings from somewhere far away, although it also contains strong elements that suggest it is a gruesome folk tale.

Likewise an account of that horrid and bloody murder, committed on the body of SERJEANT JENKINS, of the Pembrokeshire Cavalry, who was most cruelly stabbed by one Buttler, a private of said regiment, in many places, of which he died in about ten minutes, in great agony.'
Three different cases are described in this broadside. The death of George Sideserf appears to have been a freak accident, caused by a single blow in a fair fight with his companion, McDonald, who was acquitted of any crime. The second is the death of an army sergeant who was stabbed repeatedly by a private in an apparently unprovoked assault. The third case is the breaking news of a murder in Forfar and subsequent absconding of the prime suspect.

The sheet was published by Forbes and Owen of Edinburgh and cost one penny.
The first section of this broadside forms part of a sequence of broadsides dedicated to a terrible rape and murder that took place near Gilmerton, by Edinburgh. This newspaper-like broadside brings together the content of four previous broadsides on the same subject, and adds drama to the topic by moving between the courthouse and 'the condemned cell'. The second part of this broadside informs readers about other trials that have been taking place, including another rape trial and some thefts.

It was published by Thomas Duncan of Glasgow.
According to this report, Robert Ferguson denied murder on grounds of self-defence, but the witness statements suggest that after an initial argument with Captain Monro, Ferguson left for a short time and returned to the smithy armed with a knife. Evidently the jury believed that this suggested premeditated aggression, and found Ferguson guilty. The giving of Ferguson's body for dissection was an additional punishment: many believed that unless they were buried in consecrated ground, they could not gain Christian salvation.

TAKEN FROM THE SUN OF SATURDAY THE 5th SEPTEMBER, 1829.' This sheet was published by Carmichael and Graham, Trongate, Glasgow, 1829.
This is a slightly unusual broadside in that it describes a case from Bavaria, that has no particular relevance to Britain or Scotland. The story was taken from the 'Sun', an established national newspaper. It was quite common among broadside publishers to source stories from newspapers that most of their audience could not afford to buy. It is likely that this story was selected because it featured an errant priest. Anti-Catholic polemic was very common in Scotland in the early nineteenth century, and the author's sympathies are implied in the reference to the 'wonderful' trial.

Broadsides covered a wide variety of subject areas, including political and humourous songs, ballads, official government proclamations, public notices, current and historical events, and strange phenomena. The most popular by far, however, were those dealing with crime and punishment. The more gruesome the crime and extreme the punishment, the more popular the broadside.

The finding of the body of an infant near the Canal Basin . . . And the finding of the body of another infant in the Canongate Church Yard.' The publisher was Forbes and Owen of 118 High Street, Edinburgh. 
The discovery of four different bodies, in suspicious circumstances, in close proximity to each other, and on the same night, might suggest the work of a multiple murderer. When this report is read more carefully, however, there are no obvious connections between any of the deaths. The cause of Alexander Kennedy's death had not been determined at the time of reporting, but it is likely that he may have died of alcohol poisoning. The young woman, it appears, died or was murdered in Glasgow, and her body was taken to Edinburgh by coach, perhaps for use in a demonstration by an anatomist. The infant deaths may have been the result of high mortality rates among the poor, or were possibly illegitimate babies killed by desperate parents.

This report was sourced from the 'Free Press', 17th March 1827.
Although this broadside leads with the headline of 'Horrid and Barbarous' Murder, it proves to be no such thing. In fact it tells, in a light-hearted manner, of a man, bearing in mind he is a baker, who is physically violent towards his wife, 'on receiving some slight provocation from his wife, determined to knead the soft dough of her breasts and sides, so as to make her better bred'. He is momentarily startled into believing his wife is dead by a group of neighbours in the hope that he will treat her better in the future. A second report is provided at the end of the sheet, telling of a man who offers the use of his parlour for the body of his dead nephew. An ulterior motive is uncovered, however, when the man admits his intention to sell the body to the Anatomists. This would have played on people's very real concerns about body-snatching at this time.

This crime report takes the form of a separate lamentation from the two condemned prisoners, with both of the lamentations written in ballad format. The opening line of the first lamentation reads: 'You profligate young men, give ear & attend'. The opening line of the second lamentation reads: 'O now, when too late, I perceive my bad choice'.
The ballad-style lamentations contained in this broadside emphasise the importance of redemption from God, following a confession from the condemned prisoner. Both of the lamentations employ dominant religious language and imagery in order to persuade the young to stay on the path of righteousness. In addition to acting as a grim example to others, these lamentations are also intended to show that even murderers can obtain mercy from God, providing they conform to religious doctrine. This fixation with forcing sinners to reach some sort of understanding with God, reveals much about the religious nature of Scottish society during the early nineteenth century.

This sheet would have cost a penny to purchase.
It was common for broadside producers to crib information from other sources to cut down their costs and keep the information as recent as possible. Although not always attributed, the paragraphs from the 'Edinburgh Observer' have been accredited. Newspapers were a fairly new media and they reported a lot of dry, political information. This was not really of interest to the wider public and newspapers cost a lot of money both to produce and buy. Broadsides filled a niche in the market for sensational news which had a wide appeal. As a result of this wide audience base they were also used as a vehicle of moralisation.

This report sold for a penny and was published in Edinburgh by Alexander Turnbull.
This story sounds like a Grimm fairy tale; Mrs Long was a widow caring for her husband's three small children when she became involved with a 'Mr J. B    r' but he would not agree to marry a woman with three children. So Mrs Long resolved to kill the children so that she could be with her lover, locked them in a cellar for three days and eventually murdered two of them. Then, realising what she had done, she attempted to kill herself but was saved.
The report ends by wishing Mrs Long a speedy recovery so she may pay for her crime with her life. The interesting woodcut, depicting two bodies hanging at the scaffold in front of a huge crowd, forecasts her punishment.",Broadside entitled 'Horrid Murder',1824

It was published by Felix O'Neill, and taken from the 'Edinburgh Observer'.
The contents of broadsides were often sourced from established newspapers, which were generally too expensive for the predominantly working-class broadside audience. This report was apparently taken from the 'Edinburgh Observer', a paper which was based at various locations in the Old and New towns of Edinburgh between 1822 and 1845. This murder, we must assume, took place sometime between these dates.

It was published by John Muir. The report is not dated.
Illegally-distilled alcohol is cited as the catalyst for the murder of Peter Moffat by his son. In 1822 licensed whisky distilling was subject to extremely high rates of taxation, which meant that most of the whisky produced in Scotland was distilled illicitly. In the early 1820s as many as 14,000 illicit stills were being confiscated every year, and in 1823 new legislation was finally passed that lessened the duty on licensed whisky production. The term 'smuggling' in the report means 'illicit distilling', and is a use of the word specific to Scotland.

The publisher was Alexander Smellie of Edinburgh, and the broadside is dated November 13th, 1806.
The murder described in this report was motivated by a robbery that must have appeared extraordinary in its scale and ambition in 1806, when it was carried out. The murderer escaped with almost £4,400, an amount that in 2003 would be worth more than £180,000. It is inconceivable today that cash in such quantity would be carried virtually unguarded between two businesses. The seriousness with which the crime was regarded is reflected in the reward of 500 guineas that was offered to the person who helped to catch the murderer.

A particularly grisly and shocking crime is recounted in this broadside. Although jealousy is suggested as a motive in the title, there is no further mention of this within the account. Unlike many broadsides which often carried a rather pointed moral and religious lesson, this one lacks any references to repentence or religious enlightenment. The only exceptions are found in the final paragraph when Wilson kneels in an 'attitude of prayer' and is then destined to face an 'earthly tribunial' after a failed suicide attempt.

This short text reveals much about eighteenth-century society and its attitudes. The nature of husband-wife relations and the expectations of both parties are detailed in the first paragraph. The distinctions between Scots and English law are drawn further down, with the English charge of high treason being applied to this case. It finally ends on a moralising note, dominated by Satan, asking sinners to repent.

The sheet was published by Wilkins of Derby, although the story occurred in Edinburgh. A woodcut of an execution scene has been included above the title.
This story covers the infamous 'hanging' of Margaret Dickson, although the dates are quite confusing. Maggie Dickson, a Musselburgh fishwife, was convicted in Edinburgh in 1728 for murdering her own illegitimate child. The story goes that as her body was on the way to interment after the hanging, the coffin moved and Margaret stepped out, completely unharmed. She could not legally be rehanged and afterwards continued to deny the charges. She eventually had many children and died of old age. It is interesting to note that this case is reported to have occurred in 1813. Presumably the Derby printer was confident that none of his readers would have been able to tell him that it actually took place in the 1720s!
Unfortunately, due to social and religious conventions illegitimate pregnancy during the nineteenth century caused huge problems. Women dealt with this in different ways and most of these means are reported on broadsides. Some women, 'usefully', died after giving birth, whilst others simply brazened their reputation out. There are cases of midwives who performed the gruesome task of smothering babies, whilst some mothers did it themselves. A high percentage of the charges brought against women on these sheets were in relation to child murder, abuse or neglect.",Broadside regarding the execution of Margaret Dickson,1813

It was published by Mayne & Co of Glasgow.
This is an early report of sectarian violence in Glasgow. Peter O'Niel was apparently murdered when an argument about religious differences led to one gang challenging another to a fight. Around one hundred years later Bridgeton was demonised as one of the breeding grounds of the gang violence for which Glasgow became notorious in the 1920s.

This broadside provides a good opportunity to study some of the recurrent structural features of broadside crime reports. At the top of the page are two striking woodcuts showing a criminal being hanged in front of a huge crowd, and a building that is presumably a courthouse. The report itself has a fairly standard structure, a short introduction, followed by an account of the crime and the trial, and then a description of the execution, with particular emphasis on the convicts' last words and attitudes.

This broadside is one of a number held by the National Library which deal with the murder of Mrs Franks and her daughter. Ultimately Mrs Franks' son-in-law Robert Emond was convicted of the murders, but in this early report on the crime, the author reveals that another Haddington man, John Smith, is under suspicion of this and an earlier murder. Smith's family are described as 'bad characters', and have apparently been found in posession of property belonging to Mrs Franks and to a pedlar murdered six years previously.

The most successful broadside producers were often those who were quickest to publish details of a crime. This broadside is a good example of a 'breaking story'.

Due to the wide and varied audience which could be reached through the medium of the broadside, they were often used as forums for moral discussion. The men in this report are not named, suggesting that this was not the point of the report. This is further supported by the last two paragraphs on the evils of drink and lack of self-control. This broadside was published  just before temperance movements became very popular during the 1830s, and indicates public feeling leading up to this period.

The sheet it dated the 25th of April, 1829, and was most likely published in Glasgow. A note at the foot of the sheet states it was 'Printed for D. Glen'.
This broadside supposedly tells of the tragic fate that befell Helen McDougall, who was married to the notorious bodysnatcher, William Burke. However, there is also a second report on this sheet, which claims that Burke's accomplice, William Hare, had also been murdered. After fleeing vengeful mobs in Edinburgh and Glasgow, the writer claims, Helen McDougall's new partner found work in a mill in Perth. After her identity became known, however, it seems that a mob from the mill beat her to death. The second story recounts that William Hare, who had turned King's Evidence to incriminate his partner in crime, seemingly met the same violent end as Helen McDougall. Hare actually survived and apparently died in obscurity in London around 1860.

Published by William Sanderson of Edinburgh.
This broadside dates from 1835-6, when Sanderson had offices in the High Street. It boasts a fine woodcut depicting the murder. Woodcuts would often be reused, but this one appears to have been specially made because the pond is shown. Also interesting is the inclusion, at the bottom, of a ballad about the crime. This offers a more conjectural approach to the telling of the tale.

This sheet was published by Glass, on Monday 15th February [1830]. Two woodcuts are included on this sheet to increase its attractiveness and it would have sold for, unusually, two pence a sheet.
This sheet is quite unusual in its newspaper layout, with illustrations, which may account for its increased cost. The content of the report is also aimed at wringing as much emotion, sympathy and rage out of the reader as possible.

This account was published by Forbes and Owen of 118 High Street, Edinburgh. A handwritten note of the date, 14th August 1830, has been added.
This story, of the rape and murder of Margaret Paterson when she accepted the offer of a lift home from two carters, caused outrage in Edinburgh. There are many sheets reporting various stages of the trial and various confessions by Dobie and Thompson included in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

The printer was Thomas Duncan, probably the same Thomas Duncan who had printing presses in Glasgow.
For the most part, this broadside plays with the reader's emotions by stressing the doubt over Gilchrist's guilt. He continually, and eloquently, protested his innocence, saying in court, 'If I was guilty, a hundred deaths were too little for me; but, I thank the Almighty, am innocent.' Even the judge saw something in his behaviour which one couldn't ignore and admitted he was convicted on circumstantial evidence. The couple had been married for 27 years.

This sheet was published by William Robertson and would have cost a penny to buy.
Barney McGuire had already been convicted of theft and was awaiting transportation on a 'hulk'. These 'hulks' were ex-warships which were used to alleviate the pressure on prisons. They were crammed full of convicts, until there were enough to make the journey on a more sea-worthy vessel. McGuire's ship sunk thus facilitating his escape and return to crime. McGuire's relationship with Haggart was probably mentioned to make the story more sensational and relevant to the area it was published in. Haggart, a habitual criminal and escapee, was executed in Edinburgh for killing his gaoler by smashing his head with a stone - it was a huge story in Edinburgh at the time.

This was sourced from the Examiner newspaper and printed in Edinburgh in January 1823 or 1824, priced at one penny.
The case described here is among the most brutal of any in the broadsides held by the National Library of Scotland. The shocking impact it must have had is reflected in the language used in the report, where the scene of the crime is described as 'perhaps without a parallel since the first organization of civil society.' There is doubt over the date of the crime: at the start of the report the year is named as 1824, but at the foot of the page it is named as 1823.

This report was sourced from 'this Day's Observer, Aug 14', and printed by Forbes and Co. of the Cowgate, Edinburgh, most likely between 1832 and 1833.
As the report reveals, the victim of this heinous crime, James Gough, was not actually involved in the altercation which ultimately led to his murder near Ballintyne. The story has been lifted from one of the newspapers of the day, the 'Observer'. This was common practice amongst broadside publishers.

It was published by Forbes and Co of Edinburgh. These editions were sourced from the newspapers the 'North Briton' and the 'Caledonian Mercury'.
This sheet displays many typical broadside characteristics. The stories were cribbed from two daily newspapers, who only had a small circulation. There is also a first edition reprinted above the more recent report, as reusing the printing plates would have saved time and money. Stories were also covered in instalments as the action unfolded. Unusually though, this sheet criticizes the authorities' handling of a pregnant woman. It also highlights the mistakes that have been made in the previous print!

Between 1800 and 1868, 206 women were publicly hanged in the UK. After this date women were hanged either within the jail or completely in private.

This broadside was printed for William Robertson.
Although broadsides were largely sold by pedlars who bought them directly from the printer, they could also be purchased from some booksellers and stalls. There were a number of booksellers by the name of William Roberston trading in the early nineteenth century. Unfortunately, there is no way of determining which particular Robertson this broadside was printed on behalf of. Whilst there was a bookseller registered by that name at 47 Broughton Street, Edinburgh (Edinburgh Directory, 1846), there were two others - one in Blairgowrie and one in Aberdeen - with premises closer to Forfar.

No publication details have been included on this sheet.
It is unclear from this report whether the McMillans intended to murder Campbell, or whether their aim was to disfigure him. Whatever their intention, Archibald Campbell died from his wounds in Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary two weeks after the assault. Whilst Euphemia McMillan was found guilty and, despite a recommendation of mercy from the jury, sentenced to be executed, her husband, Hugh, was found to be blameless and walked free.

It is worth highlighting the fact that the McMahons' victim, Alexander Philips, is referred to in the title as 'a Jew'. It is only further into the report that he is mentioned by name. At this time, in a predominantly Presbyterian country such as Scotland, those who followed a different faith were often viewed with suspicion or treated as outsiders. This is suggested here, not only by the need to identify the man primarily by his faith as opposed to his name, but also in the description of one of the witnesses, 'Moses Henry Leiseheim was called, and sworn in the Jewish form, with his hat on his head, and hand upon the old Testament'.

Published in Edinburgh by the booksellers.
There is no date given here. However, we can guess roughly by looking at other broadsides relating to the case in the National Library of Scotland's collection. This broadside must have been printed sometime between McEwan's trial, which was held on March 1st, and the 7th of April, when McEwan was hung at the top of Libberton's Wynd in Edinburgh. A handwritten date at the bottom of the broadside suggests it was published on 27th March, but we cannot be absolutely certain of this.

Robert Emond was eventually executed for the murder of his wife's sister, Mrs Franks, and her 14-year-old daughter. As this letter was written before Emond's trial, however, he had no knowledge of the fate that awaited him. He is writing to his wife, Magdalene Munro, to reassure her of his innocence and pray that on the day of the trial God will be his advocate. Interestingly, Emond compares his own notoriety with that of Burke and Hare. The trial of William Burke had taken place only one year prior to this letter. Broadsides detailing the trial and execution of Emond are also contained in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

The letter is dated the 21st November 1720. This broadside was printed in Edinburgh by Robert Brown in 1720.
In this letter Mushet's mother urges him to confess and repent for his crimes. She condemns any attempt that will be made by a defence to free her son from a just punishment. The letter is full of references to God's mercy and Lady Boghall's deep concerns for her son if he does not seek divine forgiveness. Her religious fervour is characteristic of that which existed in Scotland at this time. Whilst 'earthly justice' was doled out in the courts, emphasis was placed on preparing oneself for 'divine justice'.

This was published in Edinburgh by Forbes & Co.
The tone of broadsides could vary greatly, from brief and sober to highly sensationalist. One of the most notable aspects of this particular example is the moralising tone assumed by its author. Cautionary verses written as if from the point of view of a murderer or victim were not uncommon, and the 'Lamentation' at the foot of this broadside is a good example. The letter reprinted here also reflects much about the moral attitudes of the male-dominated Scotish society in which it originated: Janet McLauchlane is pilloried as a drunkard and child-beater, and it is implied that her husband had little choice but to murder her. Such attitudes are another recurring feature of broadsides.

Part of a sequence of broadsides dedicated to a terrible murder that took place near Gilmerton, this broadside provides its readers with ink drawings of the guilty men and their lamentations in verse form. It appears that major crime broadsides followed a regular pattern and style, probably to make as much money out of the story as was possible before interest waned. After the news story of the crime, there would be broadsides reporting the trial and sentence. Following that, the reader would be taken into 'the condemned cell' to learn how the prisoner was bearing up and to hear their lamentation, usually in the form of a ballad. The story of the crime would end with reports of the execution.

After a futher description of the crime, there follow two verses, one bemoaning recent crimes in Scotland, the other apparently a lamentation by the condemned woman, which begins, 'Oh, all who hear of my sad state / Oh, pity my poor case' This broadside was published by Sanderson of Edinburgh, in 1834.
Broadsides featuring cautionary verses based on recent crimes were not uncommon. Broadside authors and publishers predated some modern newspaper editors in assuming the role of moral instructor to their readership. It is highly improbable that the 'Lamentation of Mary Braid' was the work of the condemned woman, and far more likely that the poem was written by the same anonymous broadside author who composed the accompanying verses. This broadside emphasises its cautionary message with a macabre woodcut depicting a woman drowning a child.
Broadsides are often crudely illustrated with woodcuts ? the earliest form of printed illustration, first used in the mid-fifteenth century. Inclusion of an illustration on a broadside increased its perceived value, especially among the illiterate. To keep costs down, publishers would normally reuse their limited stock of generic woodcuts.",Broadside entitled 'Lamentation of Mary Braid',1834

There are other reports on this case held in the National Library of Scotland's collection, suggesting that the story enjoyed popularity at the time. According to the report Banks was convicted, of killing her husband, during July 1835. She bought poison and, with the help of her daughter, administered it to Mr Banks, who it is suggested had beat her. The page then concludes with a moralising poem.
Broadsides, cheap and accessible, were often used as moral forums with 'lessons of life' included in the narrative. Broadside authors tended to see themselves as moral guardians and teachers in society. As such, publishers often disseminated 'educational' texts outlining the social and personal consequences of undisciplined or immoral behaviour.",Broadside entitled 'Lamentation of Elizabeth Banks',1835

The publisher was John Muir of Glasgow. It appears that the title of the broadside was originally 'HORRIFIC MURDER', but the top part of the sheet has been torn off.
A particularly nasty crime, apparently of a domestic nature, is described in this report. Broadside reports often sympathised with the male in crimes of violence against women, but in this instance it is stressed that Mrs Devon was 'sober and industrious' and was unfortunate in her choice of husband, who is suspected of the murder. The reference to Mrs Devon's children returning from the cotton mill suggests that they were employed as textile workers, a common occupation for children in the nineteenth century.

The sheet was published by R. Husband, Printer, 15 Princes Street, Glasgow. The Scottish Book Trade Index, available online through the National Library of Scotland's website, lists Robert Husband at 15 Prince's Street from 1825 to 1828.
This broadside tells of an exorcism in Ballymore that went tragically wrong, because it was carried out by an insane priest who was later committed to an asylum. As a result of his violent actions, one infant died and another two were left on the verge of death. Perhaps the most disturbing feature of this case is the unquestioning way in which the accompanying mob assisted the priest in his mad delusions. Indeed, this broadside does at least provide today's audience with a revealing glimpse of the superstitious nature of Irish society at this time (c. 1825), plus it also demonstrates the power of the Catholic Church.

Published in Edinburgh by Menzies, this broadside, which boasts two fine woodcuts and a poem about the event, was sold for one penny.
Peddie and Tennant were labourers who, on the day of the murder, were working together breaking stones for the road. Mr Borthwick, the Superintendent, had ordered Tennant off the job because his drinking and poor timekeeping made him a liability. Peddie, the foreman, wanted to keep Tennant on but was forced to back down. At midday, Peddie had woken Tennant from a drunken sleep at the side of the road and told him the news. A row ensued which 'ended in the murder of the poor old man'.

Unfortunately, no publication details have been included.
The National Library of Scotland's collection includes at least two other broadsides relating to this case, one of which details the character of the alleged murderer, James Moffat. An eye-witness account is provided here by 'a sailor', placing James Moffat 'or Mackcoull' in the area on the night Begbie was murdered. Whilst it is possible that Moffat did in fact murder Begbie, it is also possible that he was wrongly accused. After he was sentenced to be executed, 14 years after the crime had been committed, Moffat mysteriously died in his cell in the Calton Jail.

The most notable thing about this report is the density of biblical language employed by the author. As well as containing quotations direct from the Bible, the text contains recognisably biblical images such as 'the earth being once again wet with human blood'. It is an appropriate tone for a report warning against the moral decline of the nation. The final, portentous quotation foresees the death penalty for the accused: 'Vengeance is mine, and I will repay.'

Campbel was murdered by his cousin Patrick Campbel, Baron of Braemukly, in a fight which was the result of serious drinking. James attacked Patrick, who defended himself with his gun and shot his cousin through the heart. He then escaped to Edinburgh undetected. The author of this text, however, does not hide the fact that he is using this incident for moral education. It is also interesting to note that the 'salm' is quoted in Gaelic. There are other broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection which detail arguments, resulting in death, between 'gentlemen'.

The broadside also contains a 'Description of Damietta'. It was printed by Thomas Duncan of Glasgow in 1799.
The details of this murder are fairly scant, so the author opts to devote most of this report to cautioning women to 'conduct themselves in cases of courtship with proper circumspection'. This theme was common in broadsides reporting the murder of a woman. The implication was that men could not be held fully responsible if their violent passions were aroused by a woman's reckless or immoral behaviour.

Much as other broadsides held in the National Library of Scotland's collection have proven that news could and did travel the country quickly, just as often stories from other areas were fabricated. Here names and circumstances are given, but they do seem a little dubious.

This report was sourced from the Glasgow 'Free Press Newspaper' and was published by the Glasgow printer, W. Carse.
The Glasgow 'Free Press Newspaper' was founded in 1823 and was published until 1835. At this time, however, newspapers were very expensive to produce thus they were expensive to buy and they information they conveyed was not always of an entertaining nature. As a result, broadside publishers copied the more interesting stories onto sheets, often embellishing the narrative to improve the story's appeal further, and sold them for just a penny. The sheet was intended to be read aloud amongst a large audience and as a result the information reached an astonishingly large part of the population.

This report was published by William Henry, and was sold for a penny. The author states that the story was sourced from the 'Edinburgh Observer' newspaper.
It is interesting to note the mistakes in this text. There are large spaces and 'committed' has been misspelt. In the haste of getting the story to press, mistakes were fairly common. The immediacy is highlighted further by the fact that this story is taken from another source. A broadside would have been a cheaper option than buying a newspaper, and this one also borrows some kudos from the 'Edinburgh Observer', which apparently offers the 'only authentic notification yet published of this melancholy affair'.

This account is 'copied from the ""Edinburgh Observer"", Newspaper of this day, which is the only authentic notification yet published of this melancholy affair'. The broadsheet seen here was printed in Edinburgh for William Henry, on 12 January 1827.
By far the most popular broadsides were those covering crime. The more heinous the crime, the more copies sold. Typically, for the more sensational malefactions, a sequence of broadsides were produced detailing the crime, later discoveries or particulars, the trial, last dying speeches, and the execution. Also included in the National Library of Scotland's collection is a broadside covering the trial and sentence of Allan Grant, James Kenny Stewart, Mary Muirhead and Isabella Kerr or Gray, all four of whom were accused of the murder of Mark Dow.

It was published in Edinburgh by Forbes & Co.
Broadsides found much of their market among the working classes, who could not afford heavily-taxed newspapers. One way in which their publishers could source stories quickly for their cheap, single-sheet reports was to lift from the larger newspapers, as in this example: 'We extract the following article from the Courant Newspaper...'. 'Courant' was not an unusual name for a newspaper in eighteenth and nineteenth century Scotland, and there were papers entitled the 'Elgin Courant', the 'Glasgow Courant' and the 'Edinburgh Courant'. The latter is the most likely source of this story.

The broadside was published by T. Duncan of the Saltmarket in Glasgow. 
The report on this sheet describes the discovery of the body of a newborn child in a ditch, by a young boy. At the time the report was written the case had not gone to trial, but the child's mother was suspected of having committed the murder. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it was not uncommon for the mothers of illegitimate babies to be driven to murdering them. Illegitimacy carried a huge social stigma, and as well as the public shame endured by women who had given birth to illegitimate children, the mothers often had no financial means of supporting a child.

This sheet was published, in Edinburgh, by Felix O'Neill.
This sheet not only reports the details of David Dobie and John Thomson's rape and murder of Margaret Paterson but also carries a story about the death of two slaters when the ladder they were working on collapsed. The 'Gilmerton Murder' as the case of Margaret Paterson's death as been named, was a huge sensation at the time, if the number of extant broadsides are to be believed. As a result of its popular topic, gruesome horror, there are many different accounts of this case in the National Library of Scotland's collection.

The first story on this sheet illustrates the mechanisms of broadside publication. Firstly, this story was covered by other publishers and many of their sheets are held in the National Library of Scotland's collection. The first edition of the story is re-included on the sheet because of the expense of printing and shows how news was covered in instalments. Finally, parts of the report are cribbed from another newspaper - a common feature of the time. The second story, tried before James Patison, concerns a complaint over taxi fares!

Margaret Dickson's 'crime' was to conceal her stillborn and illegitimate baby. was convicted of murdering her own child, and as a result forfeited her life.  This  was a well-reported case at the time. Whilst being transported for burial after her execution in Edinburgh's Grassmarket, Dickson was miraculously jolted awake. The court decided that as she was already legally dead she could not be hung again! She had more children and lived for another 40 years.

Although not directly stated in the text, it appears that Wemyss, an umbrella maker, was convicted of killing his wife but had since the conviction twice appealed for a reinvestigation. The new theory revealed in this report hinges on his wife's drinking problem and the suggestion is that she suffered a brain haemorrhage or that both of them were involved in a drunken brawl. The lack of previous detail and the immediacy of the new theory report, illustrates the broadside's role as the informative and popular entertainment of its day. Wemyss was executed on 16 April 1840.

The most popular broadsides by far were those that recounted crime stories - the darker the crime the better - and this is another broadside from that genre. This broadside, quoting directly from a newspaper report, forms part of a sequence telling readers about the murder of a young woman near Gilmerton, by Edinburgh. It is quite a lengthy report, as the investigators try to jigsaw together what exactly happened to the woman, while the two accused men each try to implicate the other in the crime. Given that the entire article is surrounded by inverted commas, one wonders about copyright issues since broadsides often lifted stories straight from newspapers. It would appear that the two dashes near the end of the report is an early form of censorship.

This sheet was published by John Craig.
This broadside contains details of the events which led to the rape, robbery and murder of Margaret Paterson by two carters, David Dobie and John Thomson in 1803. The information was extracted from a newspaper, not an uncommon practice due to the lack of copyright laws. John Craig the commissioner, eventually had a newspaper office in Lauriston Street, Edinburgh during the 1840s and 50s.

This broadside is dated the 12th September, 1826.
The very fact this sheet was printed the morning after the murder of the 11th of September, illustrates how quickly broadsides followed the events they were reporting. In this instance, both stories have been sourced from the 'Edinburgh Observer'. With no copyright law to restrict such practices, broadside producers often lifted the most newsworthy and sensational stories from that day's newspaper and reproduced them as broadsides.

The murders committed by William Bolamgall appear to have been motiveless. All three victims were living under the same roof as Bolamgall - that of his father. In this broadside his murderous behaviour is blamed on the devil, 'and the Devil who had thus Prompt him to act the first Wickedness, Temps him to a Second'. It is also suggested that it was only through 'GOD'S Providence' that the entire household was not murdered. In the eighteenth century, Scotland was a highly religious society in which people's lives were dominated by the Church. This is very much reflected in the street literature of the time.

The report is apparently written by Sandy McToysh, although no date or other publication details are provided.
Unusually, this sheet is printed in two columns, very close together, with a thin black line dividing them. It tells the story of an inn-keeper near Inverness, who was in the habit of murdering his guests for their valuables. He was only caught after his wife stopped him killing one such lodger, Andrew Johnston. Undetterred and determined to get his hands on Johnson's £200, the inn-keeper attempted to have the man arrested for stealing. However, he was not to know that Johnston was of reputable character. When the inn was searched and valuables were found alongside human bones, the landlord could do nothing but confess to having murdered around 15 of his customers.

The broadside is priced at one penny.
Unusually, the victim in this instance was still alive at the time the report was written, albeit 'in a very dangerous state, with very little prospect of his recovery'. Broadsides recounting murders or murderous intent were by far and away the most popular amongst the readership. The more shocking and gruesome the crime, the more copies were sold. This particular broadside deliberately downplays the survival of the victim by revealing 'Murderous Outrage'. The intention was to make the report more appealing to the public.

The crime occurred on the 12th August 1792.
This text, although revealing many of the facts surrounding this attack, concentrates more on the behaviour and their consequences of those involved and uses it as a vehicle to warn other young lovers. This text is unusual because Margaret is portrayed in a good light and remains relatively blameless for her condition. This could, however, be because she was the victim of this brutal attack.

Not only does the style of the English make this story a little hard to follow, but the major contradiction in the narrative also leads to some confusion. It is stated that this text was declared by Robert Irving and that he is now brought to trial for it. Further down the page, however, it is also reported that, after committing the two murders, Irving slit his own throat and threw himself in the water.

Society at this time believed the Devil influenced their daily lives and as a result his work is emphasised here. This belief was eventually championed by James VI and I of Great Britain (1566-1625), himself. He wrote various tracts on the Devil and witchcraft and suffered from the misapprehension that witches were trying to assassinate him. With these ideas filtering from the top, down, and such high profile support, society found it easy to believe in the power of the Devil.

15201,murder,F.3.a.14(53),"This report begins: 'A Fourth Edition, containing New and Interesting Particulars of that most heart-rending and cruel Rape, Robbery, and Murder, of Margaret Paterson, at Gutterdike near Gilmerton, on the night of Saturday, the 24th of April, 1830, -- together with a particular and accurate Account of the unheard of manner in which the Monsters occasioned the death of their victim, to the everlasting Disgrace of civilised society, -- and also an accurate Account and Description of the two Men who are charged with committing this truly Fearful Crime, and of the Precognition taking against them by the Sheriff of the County, -- and likewise the pious conduct of the ill fated, Murdered Margaret Paterson, on her Death-Bed, a few minutes before she expired, -- being a True and Faithful account of this Dreadful Affair, never any where published except in this paper.'
Running to a fourth edition, this exclusive broadside tells the tragic of Margaret Paterson, who was raped, robbed and murdered by two men near Gilmerton, Edinburgh. This broadside certainly goes into great detail concerning both the crime and the three protagonists. Broadsides that told of recent crimes - the more heinous the crime the better - sold numerous copies, as demonstrated by the fact that this broadside is a fourth edition. Exclusivity is another theme of this broadside, with the writer emphasising, right from the outset, that the public can only read about the story in this particular broadside. This sheet is part of a series of broadsides on this particular subject, with the others available for viewing at The National Library of Scotland's collection.

This sheet was published by Forbes and Owen of the 'First Stair in the Close', the High Street, Edinburgh.
Two other stories are carried on this sheet: an account of Captain Wilson's murder of the seaman John Smith on his ship 'Armenia', and the funeral of King Radama of Madagascar. These may seem like an odd selection of texts but broadside publishers reported anything of public interest knowing that they would reach a wide audience. The last story, especially, appears odd, but Britain had close diplomatic and cultural links with Madagascar, after its military involvement in establishing the state.

The National Library of Scotland's collection also includes a broadside giving a detailed account of Dow's murder and robbery. Published a day or two after the incident, the names of the suspects were not included. This broadside, however, reports on the trial and sentencing of the four accused.

The sheet was published by Menzies of Edinburgh.
James Dalrymple and Donald Fraser were labourers, and Dalrymple had shot Fraser on the Linlithgow to Queensferry road, near the Burgh-muir toll-bar. The reason for the attack is not given, although it appears, from witnesses, that there was no doubt that Dalrymple was the culprit. Although found guilty, the jury strongly recommended mercy. The plea was not heard and Dalrymple was sentenced to be executed the following month. It is possible that his sentence was commuted later as there is no record of the execution.

The publisher was William Carse of Glasgow, and the publication date was 14th June 1824.
The motivation for William Divan's crime is left vague in the account of his trial. It is merely suggested that while his wife worked hard for the benefit of the family, he was only interested in getting her earnings 'for the purpose of enabling him to join in company with his acquaintance', in other words, drinking. Divan is sentenced to death. In the other case on this sheet, Samuel McMenemy is sentenced to twelve months hard labour at Bridewell house of correction.

The National Library of Scotland's collection includes another, similar, broadside recounting the trial and sentence of Andrew Ewart. Whilst most of the information appears to be the same on both sheets, this particular one describes in more detail the events immediately leading up to the murder of Henry Pennycook (or Pennycuick). On watch in Liberton churchyard, Ewart fatally wounded his friend, Pennycook, after mistaking him for a body-snatcher.

The National Library of Scotland's collection includes a number of other broadsides detailing the trial and sentence of Andrew Ewart. It is possible the tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Henry Pennycook (or Pennycuick) sparked a lot of interest amongst the broadside readership.

Also included in the National Library of Scotland's collection are two further broadsides covering this rather grisly case. Both claim to provide an account of Glen's execution, including his behaviour on the scaffold. The very fact that a further broadside was published regarding Glen's crime, indicates the high level of interest in this case. The more gruesome and shocking the crime being reported, the more copies sold. Broadside printers often cashed in on this popularity by producing a series of sheets covering different aspects of the same crime.

The broadside is not dated and carries no publication details.
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the murder of newborn children by their mothers was probably more common than it is today. There was a huge social stigma attached to illegitimacy that drove some women to kill rather than face the public disgrace that she, and the child, would undoubtedly endure. This case in this broadside is more unusual, in that the accused women was already known to have had and raised several illegitimate children. However, there were other social complications. Many unmarried women were simply in no financial position to raise a child, and post-natal depression, which was not acknowledged until the twentieth century, may, in retrospect, have also been a contributory factor.

Part of a sequence of broadsides dedicated to a terrible murder that took place near Gilmerton, this third edition broadside moves between the courtroom and 'the condemned cell'. After providing details of the crime, the broadside then considers the demeanour of the two accused carters - John Thomson and David Dobie - as they enter 'the condemned cell'. Following a summary from The Lord Justice Clerk that often threatens to turn into a hellfire sermon, the prisoners are told that their bodies will be spirited away immediately after execution for dissection in an anatomy class. It would appear that sending corpses straight from the scaffold to an anatomy class was an old tradition.

William Pollock was found guilty of murdering his wife and sentenced to be hanged on the 22nd March, 1826. Although he vehemently protested his innocence throughout the trial, and continued to do so after sentence was passed, Pollock was never offered a reprieve. Two days before the execution was to take place, Pollock committed suicide in his prison cell. A large number of broadsides were published following Pollock's suicide, including this imaginary lamentation.

This sheet was printed in 1819 by John Muir of Glasgow.
This broadside tells of an elopement that went disastrously wrong. The elopement was between a wealthy and accomplished girl from the county of Limerick, and a 'gentleman' apparently from Dublin. Tragically, the girl ended up being murdered by the gentleman's servant, with both master and servant being executed for the terrible crime. With its emphasis on female accomplishments, gentlemanly behaviour and servants, the broadside reveals much about upper-class Irish society during the early nineteenth century. Certainly, the fact that the gentleman ordered his servant to kill the girl and then blamed his subordinate for committing the crime, suggests much about a lack of responsibility on the part of the 'gentleman'.

This broadside was printed in Edinburgh for William Henry and priced at one penny.
Broadsides were printed rather crudely on low quality paper. This was to ensure production costs were kept to a minimum. Priced cheaply at one penny or occasionally a half penny, they had a vast readership amongst the working classes. Whilst the cost to the reader was low, the sheer quantities printed earned healthy profits for those involved in their production. Sales of a broadside detailing a particularly sensational or gruesome murder often ran into the thousands.

Alexander, on 6th September last, who died in the Infirmary on the 8th, September, in consequence.' This broadside was printed for William Henry and cost one penny.
Despite the severity of this crime, and the number of witnesses who willingly came forward, neither Alexander nor Blackwood were sentenced to be executed. Alexander was found guilty of culpable homicide and sentenced to transportation for 14 years, and a not proven verdict was returned for Blackwood. In Scots law the not proven verdict effectively produces the same result as not guilty: the accused walks free and can never be tried again for the same crime. Not proven, however, leaves an element of doubt, suggesting that the accused is considered guilty by the court, but not beyond reasonable doubt.

It was published by William Carse of Glasgow, and probably sold for one penny.
The National Library of Scotland's collection includes at least four other broadsides detailing this case. A particularly heinous crime, it would have attracted a lot of attention from the public. Special mention is given at the end of this broadside to the alleged mutilation of the victims' faces, along with the hope that, 'for the honour of Scotland', the account has been exaggerated.

Another broadside in the National Library of Scotland's collection details Moffat's confession and incarceration. Although the first name of the accused differs from this sheet, with him referred to as Thomas, they are most likely the same person. Such inaccuracies were common and merely help to illustrate the lackadaisical approach to reporting that existed.

Apparently no relation to the famous Scottish Protestant reformer, John Knox (1505?-72), this particular John Knox nevertheless chooses to take the religious and moralistic high ground in his dying speech. Rather than being a supporter of the Protestant faith, however, his allegiance to the Church of Rome is clear through his support for the 'only Rightful Soveraign [sic] K.

What, Belcou! how are you my friend? you look sad. / Bal. no. do I?'  The broadside was published by William Shepherd at the Poet's Box, 182 Overgate, Dundee. It does not carry a price or a date of publication.
Marriage was a common source of comedy in broadside ballads and sketches. Ironically, given that men in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries enjoyed far more social freedoms and advantages than women, such broadsides often depicted women getting the better of men or being the dominant partners. This dialogue is typical in making fun of men. It features two men arguing over the merits of their respective fiancées. The punchline to the routine comes when the two discover they are both engaged to the same woman.
The Dundee Poets? Box was in operation from about 1880 to 1945, though it is possible that some material was printed as early as the 1850s. Most of the time it had premises at various addresses in Overgate. In 1885 the proprietor J.G. Scott (at 182 Overgate) had published a catalogue of 2,000 titles consisting of included humorous recitations, dialogues, temperance songs,  medleys, parodies, love songs, Jacobite songs. Another proprietor in the 1880s was William Shepherd, but little is known about him. Poets? Box was particularly busy on market days and feeing days when country folk were in town in large numbers. Macartney specialised in local songs and bothy ballads. Many Irish songs were published by the Poets? Box ? many Irishmen worked seasonally harvesting potatoes and also in the jute mills. In 1906 John Lowden Macartney took over as proprietor of the Poet?s Box, initially working from 181 Overgate and later from no.203 and 207.
It is not clear what the connection between the different Poet?s Boxes were. They almost certainly sold each other?s sheets. It is known that John Sanderson in Edinburgh often wrote to the Leitches in Glasgow for songs and that later his brother Charles obtained copies of songs from the Dundee Poet?s Box. There was also a Poet?s Box in Belfast from 1846 to 1856 at the address of the printer James Moore, and one at Paisley in the early 1850s, owned by William Anderson.

Broadsides were often used to challenge political beliefs. Expressing an unpopular or contrary opinion in this format was not only safe, as they were largely anonymous, but they also reached a wide and varied audience, cheaply and quickly. This story's appeal lies in its immediacy and gravity. As a result very little factual information has been included - the reader already having topical knowledge, supposedly - and so it does now become quite a frustrating source to use. From other broadsides in the National Library of Scotland's collection, it can be assumed that Bean was involved in a riot in favour of the Old Pretender, James Edward Stuart in May 1716.

Charles Hope's father bought the Hopetoun Estates just outside Edinburgh, in 1678. Charles and his mother, Margaret, commissioned Sir Willliam Bruce, with the help of Robert Adam, to build Hopetoun House in 1699. Charles became 1st Earl of Hopetoun in 1703.

Weddings between people of vastly differing generations seemed to be regarded with great amusement and interest by Scots of the early nineteenth century, and the National Library of Scotland holds more than one broadside on the theme.

The wedding described culminates with the bride absconding with the groom's money and her former lover as the guests fight among themselves and the groom sleeps.

Although no publication details are included on this sheet, it must have been published shortly after Monday the 6th of April, 1702, which is the date when the couple became husband and wife.
This broadside takes the form of an epithalamium - that is, a song or poem in celebration of a marriage. In this epithalamium, the writer celebrates the marriage of James Marquess of Montrose to Lady Christian Carnegie, on Monday the 6th of April, 1702. James Graham was the grandson of the celebrated Marquis of Montrose, while Christian Carnegie was the daughter of the late Earl of North Esk. Clearly, this was very much a high society wedding of its time. Although there is little information about their marriage, the couple produced three sons: David Graham, 1st Earl Graham; William Graham, 2nd Duke of Montrose; and George Graham, MP.

16586,marriage,RB.m.168(001),"Verse 1 begins: 'Now you married women all, / Your attention I do call, / And a good advice ill give you I am thinking, / For the husband I have got'. The woodcut at the top of the sheet depicts a well-dressed couple standing in a leafy clearing. They appear to have fallen out, however, as their bodies are stiff and turned away from one another.
This poem, unusually for broadside literature, reveals the horrors of alcoholism. The fact that Biddy, the wife, is beaten, their children starve and most of their possessions have been sold is all clearly delineated in the text. No censure of Barney for this behaviour or a real solution to the problem is presented though. It is also implicit in the text that there is no avenue of refuge or escape for Barney's family in their society. Biddy's rather novel attempt at a solution is to sew her husband into his bed sheets, when he falls asleep drunk. As a result Barney was reformed!
Early ballads were dramatic or humorous narrative songs derived from folk culture that predated printing. Originally perpetuated by word of mouth, many ballads survive because they were recorded on broadsides. Musical notation was rarely printed, as tunes were usually established favourites. The term 'ballad' eventually applied more broadly to any kind of topical or popular verse.",Broadside ballad entitled 'An Advice to Married Women',1850-1870

Written entirely in verse form and from a first person viewpoint, this broadside claims to be the last speech and confession of Jannet Riddle, who was executed in 1702 for killing her own child - the sex of which is not identified. Given the low level of literacy at this time, it is highly unlikely that Jannet Riddle actually wrote this ballad. It was probably written by a professional broadside writer who knew that sheets reporting crime sold numerous copies. After detailing the bloody act, the ballad goes on to confess the crime and begs the Lord for mercy.

16019,last,6.365(104),"This execution notice begins: 'The last Speech and dying Declaration of JAMES HENDERSON, late in Bainshole, who was executed at Aberdeen, on Friday the 29th day of October 1790, for the murder of Alexander Gillespie, Slater, and his body given to the Surgeons to be dissected.' This sheet was first printed in Aberdeen by James Chalmers and then reprinted in Glasgow.    
 
Henderson  murdered Gillespie with an axe, when the latter called peacably at his house, asking for a drink. James Chalmers (1742-1810), the son of James Chalmers, enjoyed a full and varied career in the field of publishing. Although broadsides and chapbooks produced by him survive, he was also responsible for publishing religious volumes and story-books. He began business in 1764 and became a Company in 1771. He also went into the paper-mill business with his son-in-law. He eventually became embroiled in an inconclusive pamphlet war with George Forbes, a Dundonian advocate.
Reports recounting dark and salacious deeds were popular with the public, and, like today's sensationalist tabloids, sold in large numbers. Crimes could generate sequences of sheets covering descriptive accounts, court proceedings, last words, lamentations and executions as they occurred.

This sheet was printed in Edinburgh, at the bottom of Horse Wynd, in 1720.
Helen Marishal was nineteen when she was convicted of murdering her illegitimate child. She recounts how she birthed the child herself, hid the evidence and continued working - quite a terrifying experience for a nineteen-year-old. She is being punished, according to this text, not for fornication, but for disobeying her parents and killing an innocent child.

Although this would have been an excellent opportunity to entertain the audience with sordid and squalid details of an incestuous relationship, this text takes a higher moral tone. Reflecting the concerns of society at the time, emphasis is placed on parental guidance and control, and living a Godly and worthy life. It is interesting to note that David dies repentant, while his sister died 'obdurate and obstinately', unrepentant.

It was normal for some sort of 'last speech' from the sentenced prisoner to be reported by broadside publishers. Whether they actually happened or not and whether all the reporting was accurate is, however, another matter. These last speeches were often used as a forum for philosophising and moralising on anti-social behaviour. This document, however authentic, does not even mention anti-social behaviour, rather it is a list of persons who have received a copy of the letter. It is in fact a rather odd document to leave as one's last comment on earth! Layer was executed on 17 May 1723.

16656,last,APS.4.82.28,"This comic broadside begins: 'The DEADLY GROANS of the WHISKY STILLS: who were condemned to suffer Martyrdom on the 17th of thei spresent month of July 1795, for the horrid and bloody murder of starving above 200,000 professed Christians in this island. With the sorrowful lamentation of all the Dram-Drinkers.' There are no publication details included.
Last words or speeches from the scaffold, attributed to condemned criminals, were quite commonly printed on broadsides. The example shown here is a parody of the 'last word' category of broadside. It is supposedly narrated by a whisky still facing 'execution'. This comic piece was undoubtedly inspired by the crackdown on illegal whisky distilling which occurred in the late eighteenth century. The vast majority of whisky in Scotland was produced illicitly from illegal stills, due to the high taxation on malt whisky, and in the 1780s and 1790s, thousands of illegal stills were seized and destroyed.

Scotland's legal profession, at this time, adhered to the 'bloody code' which protected the upper-classes' property at all costs. Murder, however, still carried a high penalty, even amongst the working class. This sensational and sordid story would probably have sold to a wide audience, with its narrative of brotherhood betrayed, sound advice ignored and the juxtaposition of the good mother and the evil younger woman. Broadsides were the forerunners of modern newspapers due to the stories they covered, the style they were written in and the audience they could reach.

In many cases, broadside producers published fictitious last speeches that were high on repentence and moral instruction. Not only did they sell well, but many broadside publishers felt an obligation to the moral well-being of their readership. The paper delivered by Captain John Bruce before his execution, however, does ring true. Executed in Lancaster, England, for his undying allegiance to James III (the Old Pretender), Bruce reaffirmed his loyalty to James and declared that he was 'not ashamed for that Cause for which I die'.
