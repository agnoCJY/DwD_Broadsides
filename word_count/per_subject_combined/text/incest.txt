Shameful Case of Incest.

A Full, True, and Particular Account of that most extraordinary
shameful and disgraceful case of Incest between the Minister of
the parish of Logie, in Ross-shire, and his own, sister, She was
seized with the pains of child-birth, while playing at her piano,
on the 5th of November last, - her brother being at the time as-
sisting at the dispensation of the Sacrament in a neighbouring
parish. Together with an account of his confession of the un-
natural crime, and his resignation of his holy office.

The parish church of Logie, in the county of Ross, has again
become vacant, and under circcumstances of the most painful and
awful description.    As the case will soon come publicly before the
Presbytery, and as a hundred idle reports (some of them implicat-
ing innocent persons in a neighbouring county) are afloat on the
subject, we shall briefly recapitulate the facts,    On the 5th of No-
vember last, Miss K., sister of the minister of the parish, who re-
sided in the manse and superintended the domestic establishment,-
was suddenly taken ill while playing on the piano-forte.  Her bro-
ther was absent,  assisting to dispense the Sacrament in another
place, but aid wss immediately procured.    The young lady's ill-
ness continued to increase, and at length  (to the grief and astonish-
ment of those present, who never once suspected her condition) she
was delivered of a child.    She had made no preparation for the e-
vent, and she refused to give any information as to the paternity
of the infant,     About ten days passed over,  when the minister dis-
appeared, leaving his church and flock.     No person knew whither
he had gone, but in a short time the  Moderator of the Presbytery
received a letter from him written from  Aberdeen, acknowledging
an incestuous connection, and resigning his living.      The effect of
such intelligence on the virtuous and religious inhabitants of that
district, we shall not attempt to describe.    The unfortunate female
who had participated in the unnatural guilt of her brotner, was pur-
sued to the west coast, whither she had fled, was apprehended, and
brought last week to Dingwall.    From the latter place she was con-
veyed in a chaise, accompanied by an officer and a female attend-
ant to Tain ; but while the man left the vehicle for a few moments
to wait upon the sheriff with an account of her apprehension, or to
receive fresh instructions, the offender and her attendant alighted
from the chaise and escaped.    We know not whether they have
been closely pursued, but we sincerely trust that they will elude
detection, and thus prevent a trial which would be fraught with so
much sorrow, shame, and disgrace.-Inverness Courier, Dec. 1336.TRIAL AND SENTENCE.

A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sentence of THOMAS BRAID
and MARY BRAID or MORISON, Brother and Sister-german, who were
tried yesterday (Monday), before the High Court of Justiciary, for INCEST
and MURDER, and who are, Mary Braid or Morison to be Executed on
Monday the 17th February, and her body to be buried within the precincts
of the Jail, and Thomas Braid to be Banished for Life.

ON Monday the 27th January, 1834, came on the ttial of THOMAS BRAID
and MARY BRAID or MORISON, brother and sister-german, accused of
Incest and Murder, both of which crimes are forbidden by the laws of God and
man. In the 18th chapter of Leviticus, incest is particularly forbidden, under
the severest denuncaitions ; and, in an act passed in the first Parliament of James
the Sixth, it is there statuted to be punishable to the death. The sixth com-
mandment says, " Thou shalt not kill ;" and, in another part of holy writ, it is
stated—" Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man his blood shall be shed,"

" Notwithstanding which, the libel charges the said Thomas Braid and Mary
Braid or Morison, both and each, or one or other of them, guilty of the said
crimes of incest and murder, or of one or other of them, actors or actor, or art
and part: in so far as, during the years 1832 and 1833, or part thereof, and at
various places within the county of Edinburgh, you the said Thomas Braid and
Mary Braid or Morison, being brother and sister-german as aforesaid, did wick-
edly and unlawfully carry on an incestuous intercourse with each other: In
particular, (1.) During the months of May, June, July, August, September, Octo-
ber, November and December, 1832, and January and February, 1833, or part
thereof, within the house at Stenhouse, in the parish of Libberton, and county
of Edinburgh, then occupied by Janet Begbie or Braid, your mother, or else-
where, to the prosecutor unknown, in the said parish of Libberton, or near vici-
nity, you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Morison, being brother
and sister-german as aforesaid, did wickedly and unlawfully carry on an inces-
tuous intercourse together, and did, on various occasions, during the said period,
abuse your bodies with each other; and, in consequence of the said incestuous
intercourse, you the said Mary Braid or Morison became pregnant, and were
thereafter delivered of a living female child, on or about the 10th day of April,
1833, within the house in the Canongate, in or near Edinburgh, then occupied
by Charity Anderson or Hardy, widow, then residing there, and now or lately
residing in Hill Place, in or near Edinburgh : Likeas, (2.) during the months of
March, April and May, 1833, or part thereof, within the house in Canongate
aforesaid, then occupied as aforesaid by the said Charity Anderson or Hardy,
you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Morison, being brother and sister-
german as aforesaid, did wickedly and unlawfully carry on an incestuous inter-
course with each other, and did cohabit together as husband and wife, and on
various occasions, during the said period, were there in naked bed together, and
did abuse your bodies with each other : Likeas, (3.) During the months of June,
July and August, 1833, or part thereof, within the house in the Canongate afore-
said, then occupied by you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Mori son,
or by one or other of you, you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Mori-
son, being brother and sister-german as aforesaid, did wickedly and unlawfully
carry on an incestuous intercourse with each other, and on various occasions,
during the said period, were there in naked bed together, and did abuse your
bodies with each other : Moreover, you the said Mary Braid or Morison, having,
on or about the 10th day of April, 1833, been delivered of a living female child,
of which you had become pregnant, in consequence as aforesaid, of the incestu-
ous intercourse above libelled, or in consequence of other carnal intercourse to
the prosecutor unknown, you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Mori-
son did, both and each, or one or other of you, upon the 16th day of August,
1833, or upon one or other of the days of that month or of July immediately
preceding, or of September immediately following, at or near to a part of the
Edinburgh and Glasgow Union Canal, near to the first stone-bridge on the said
Canal, as reckoned from Port-Hopetoun in or near Edinburgh, or at or near to
some other part of the said Canal betwixt Port-Hopetoun aforesaid and the second
stone-bridge on the said Canal, reckoned as aforesaid, or elsewhere, to the prose-
cutor unknown, in the county of Edinburgh, wickedly and felonicusly put to
death and murder the said child, by throwing it into the said Canal, having a
rope fastened round its neck, and a stone, or some other heavy substance, like-
wise attached to the said rope, for the purpose of sinking its body in the water,
and by leaving it there sunk accordingly, or by some other means to the prose-
cutor unknown ; and the dead body or the said child, which was murdered by
you the said Thomas Braid and Mary Braid or Morison, or by one or other of
you, was thereafter, on or about the 22d day of August, 1833, found floating in
the said Canal, near to the first stone-bridge aforesaid."

In support of these henious charges, thirty-six witnesses were adduced, but
the trial having proceeded with closed doors, we cannot, of course, state any par-
ticulars of the evidence. Some exculpatory witnesses were then examined, when
the Jury were addressed for the prosecution, by the Solicitor-General, and for
the prisoners, by Mr Monteith, at considerable length. The presiding Judge, Lord
Meadowbank, summed up the evidence, and the Jury found Mary Baird or
Morison, guilty, but the libel not proven against Thomas Braid. The former
was then sentenced to be executed on the morning of the 17th February next,
and her body to be buried within the precincts of the Jail,—the latter to be
banished beyond seas for the period of his natural life. This trial created a great
deal of interest, and lasted nearly eighteen hours.  [MENZIES, Printer.
