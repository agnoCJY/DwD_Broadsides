My friend and I struck frae Millgye,

For Glasgow town we took our way,
When all along the road was strung,

With lads and bonnie lasses gay.
When drawing nigh I one did spy,

She was walking slowly by hersel' ;
For fear the rain would spoil her claes,

I did display my umberell'.

Where are you gaun, my bonnie lass ?

How far, then, are you gaun this way ?
To Glasgow town, sir, I am bound,

For this, you know, is feeing day.
Says I, the day seems wet to be,

Although the morning did look fine ;
Smiling, she said, I am afraid

Oh ! cheer your heart, my bonnic lass,

We'll hae guid weather by and bye,
And don't be sad when with a lad,'

A roving baker free Millgye.
And if you will accept a gill

Of whisky, brandy, rum, or wine,
We'll hae a gill, and then we will

Be in Glasgow by the feeing time.

She gave consent, and in we went

 To an alo-house that was by the way ;

Glass after glass around did pass,

 Till we baith forgot' t was feeing day.

The clock struck three, she smiled on me,

Says she, young man, the fault is thinc,
For night is on, and I'm from home,
And, besides, I've lost the fecing time.

It's lass, don't grieve, for while I live,

I nc'er intend to harm you,
For marriage I will surely try,

For baker lads they aye prove true.

Besides,  my  mither has nauc but me,
But I'll comply, and ne'er deny,
And I'll wod  before I take a fee.

Wo spent the night in merriment,

So we got married the next day,
And aye since syne my love does say,

I'm glad I lost the feeing day.
My love and I we do agree,

I ne'er do think she will repine,
For every day  she smiles and says,

I'm glad I lost the feeing time.I GAED HAME WI' JESSIE.


The moon was shedding lustre
O'er field and forest far,
And joyous love was streaming
Frae mony a happy star;
The merry burn was singing
Wi' ne'er a thocht o' care,
As I gaed hame wi' Jessie
Frae the Fair.

In stillness and in sweetness
The world around us lay,
Dreaming the dreams of beauty
That never come by day;
My heart, in tune wi' nature,
Wove blissful fancies there,
As I gaed hame wi' Jessie
Frae the Fair.

O, mony are the pleasures
The years in passing bring,
And dear to us the mem'ries
That roun' thae pleasures cling;
But dearer than the dearest
I count the evening rare
When I gaed hame WI' Jessie
Frae the Fair.

I envy not the grandeur
Or riohes of the great,
For love, the heart 's best treasure,
Comes not with high estate;
The joys that wealth can purchase
Can ne'er wi' mine compare,
For I gaed hame wi' Jessie
Frae the Fair.

—TOBERMORY.A FUNNY CONVERSATION

Between



Cuddy WILLIE, the Pigman, and HAWKIE, the Speech
Crier, Twa Celebrated and Well-known Characters
in Edinburgh, on occasion of the Last All-Hallow
Fair, held in the Vicinity of Auld Reekie.

ALL Hallow Fair had scarce begun,
When noise on noise, like morning gun,
Cam' frae the wast an' frae the east,
No like to man but rather beast.
The cry frae CUDDIE WILL was loud,
Which first alarmed the Keelie crowd,
The next was HAWKIE, cunning elf,
Wha's rhyming Rhymes made by himself;
When they twa met—a feast to see,
Them crying pigs and poetry.

 But to the meeting of our heros,
The one for voice, the other stories,

                                                                             

HAWKIE.

Weel Cuddie, man what's a' the news,

Will Christians soon reform Jews,

Or will the Turks tak' Portobello,

Whar grows your pigs baith blue and yellow,

Or will they turn by transmigration,

Your cuddie into a great nation ;

Na na, friend Willie, that can ne'er tell,

As lang as you and I can loud yell.

CUDDIE,

D—n you and Turks and a sic foolery,
Gie me my ass an' a' my jewellery,
I care for neither Turk nor Jew,
Gie me my ass and gude Scots blue.

HAWKIE.     

But Cuddie, e'er the Fair begin,

I think it wadna be a sin,

To some gude tent let us loup in,

And prie a drap of yill or gin,               

And drink gude luck whate'er sude happen,

Like other fowk let's tak' our chappin ;

For we, like drovers and horse-cowpers,

We are but only black land lowpers,

We'll cheat and lie like a' our trade,

To such, dear Willie, we were  bred.

CUDDIE.

Weel weel, quo Will, a bargain bc't,
Come let's go in and tak' our bead,
And tho' my bowls be crack't and chippet,
Not one of them are Hawkie lippet;
Come gie's a gill, cries Willie loud,
His thund'ring voice soon brought a crowd,
Which made poor Willie's favourite Cuddie,
Like to himself not very studdie ;
They took their dram and to their wark,
And sung and cry'd till it was dark,
And then they met like honest thieves,
When Hawk took stick and Cudd took neeves,
Till baith were quarter'd in an office,
Not a bed-chamber, but a police,
Till ten o'clock neist day a'tweel,
Made baith poor Cudd and Hawk to feel,
They baith had cash poor souls to pay,
For fechting on our gude Fair day ;
So out they cam' wi' hanging face,                  

Then baith shook hands and cry'd alas !         

.         The bad effects o' too much gas.
