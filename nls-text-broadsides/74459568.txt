THE GALLANT

F O R T Y - T W A,

Copies of this popular Song can always he at the Poet's Box,
182 OVERGATE, DUNDEE.

It's noo I am a sodger, and they ca' me Willie Brown,
I used to be a weaver lad, and lived in Maxweltown,
But noo I am enlisted, and to Perth I going a va'
To join that gallant regiment that's cau'd the gallant
forty-twa.

CHORUSâ€”

Noo, you talk aboot your First Royals, and your Scot-
tish Fusileers,

And your Aberdeen Militia, and your Dundee Volun-
teers,

Or any other regiment that's lying far awa,'

But bring to me the tartan of the gallant forty-twa.

Noo, the first day I went to drill wi' I lot o' raw recruits,
The wergent-major checked me for looing at my boots,
He tapped me on the shoulder, and says, Jock come

awa,'

For I think you'll make an awfu' mess o' the gallant
forty-twa.

Noo, when the bugle sounded for the dinner time,
I was the first man at the table, and in my hand a spoon,
The sergant came to call the roll, and the officer and all,
And they pointed out the bull of the gallant forty-twa.

Noo, when I get a furlough, to Dundee I will gang,
And   I'll show a' my comrades the way to handle a gun;
I'll tak' them in, and stand them a treat, and then I'll

start to blaw,
And they will see I'm a corporal in the gallant froty-

twa.
