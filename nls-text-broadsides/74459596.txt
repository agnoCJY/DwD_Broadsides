The Irish Emigrant

I'm sitting on the stile Mary,

Where we sat side by side,
On a bright May  morning long ago,

When first you were my laide.
The corn was springing fresh and green,

And the lark sang loud and high;
And the red was on your lip,Mary,

And the love light in your eye.

The place is little changed Mary,

The day as bright as  then ;—
The lark's loud song it in mine ear,

And the corn is green again,

But I miss the sôft clasp of your hand,
And the breath warm on my cheek;

And I still keep listening for the words
You never more may speak.

'Tis but a step down yonder lane,

And the little church stands near;

The church where we were wed Mary,-

I see the spire from here,

But the grave-yard lies between, Mary.—

And my steps might break your rest.
For I've laid you, darling, down to rest,

With your baby on your breast.
I'm very lonely now, Mary,

For the poor make no new friend;
But, oh ! they love the better far,

The few our father sends,
And you was all I had Mary,-

My blessing and my pride,

There's nothing left to care for, now,
Since my poor Mary died.

Yours was the good brave heart, Mary,

That still kept hoping on;
When the trust in God had left my soul.

And my arm's strong strength had gold

There was comfort on your lip Mary,

And the kind look on your brow;
I thank you Mary, for the same—

Though you cannot hear me now,

I thank you for the patient smile,

When your heart was like to break   
When the hunger pain was gnawing there,

And you hid it for my sake.
I bless you for the pleasant word,

When your heart was sad and sore;
Oh ! I'm thankful you are gone, Mary,

Where grief can't reach you more!
I'm bidding you a long farewell.

My Mary kind and true;
But I'll not forget you, darling,

In the land I'm going to.
They way there's bread an d work for all,

And the sun shines always there;
But I'll ne'er forget Old Ireland,

Were it fifty times' as fair,
