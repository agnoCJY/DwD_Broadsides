WHEN

Comes Marching Home.

When Johnny comes marching homs again, hurrah ! hurrah
We'll give him a hearty welcome then, hurrah, hurrah; 
The  men will cheer, the boys will shout, the ladies they will
all turn out,
We'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.

Chorus

The old church bells will peel with joy, hurrah, hurrah,
To welcome home our darling boy, hurrah, hurrah ;
The villiage lads and lasses say, with roses they will strew the
way,
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home

Both old and young of each degree, hurrah, hurrah,
Will run onr hero for to see, hurrah, hurrah;
And lads lads lasses on the green,
So merrily Dancing will be seen,
And well all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.

He will tell us of the deeds he's done, hurrah, hurrah,
And all the battlhs he has won, hurrah, hurrah;
And how he made the foe to fly,
When death and victory was the cry,
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.

Get ready for the Jubilee, hurrah, hurrah,
We'll give the hero three times three, hurrah, hurrah ;
The laurel wreath is ready now to place upon his loyal brow,
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home.

Let love and friendship on that day, hurrah, hurrah,
The choicest treasures then display, hurrah, hurrah;
And let each one perform some part,
To fill with joy the warrior's heart,
And we'll all feel gay when Johnny cones Marching home,
