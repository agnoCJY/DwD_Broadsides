CALEDONIA'S DETERMINATION.

Caledonia no more shall by Tories be school'd,
Too long by the knaves she's already been rul'd:
And the Whig's but a Tory in sheep-skin disguise,
On the loaves and the fishes each fixes his eyes:
Each is ready to knuckle to wealth and to power,
And yield to the Minister in for the hour.
But the friend of the people—the radical soul—
Let him be the chief, and the first at the poll.
Since coaches are made for the proud and the rich,
I scarcely would trust to the Coachmaker's pitch ;
He'd be blazoning arms on the pannels of state,
And greasing his wheels in the midst of debate.
From lawyers, God keep us, of every degree !
Their only constituents are fat bribes and fee.
Then up with our Aytoun, the man of our hearts,
Who joins independence with wisdom and parts;
He never will flinch his high duty to do,
Nor unite in cabal, whether former or new:
As a Radical ought, he will strike to the root,
And corruption's vile scabs sear from head to the
foot.
He's his country's friend, to the sap and the core,
And  each change my-coat-trick from his heart
will abhor.
Auld Reekie, Auld Reekie, thou fam'd ancient
town,
Which science and learning have filled with re-
nown,
Who's natives are loyal, free-hearted, and bold,
In the days that are now, as in ages of old;
Twere a vile lying proxy, that ever should stand,
If not firm with thee, heart in heart, hand in hand,
To redress each abuse that distresses the Isles,
To fetter all tyrants, to baffle all wiles ;—
Each foe to true freedom to spurn and defy : 
For freedom to speak, to live, and to die.
