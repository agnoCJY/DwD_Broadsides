My friend and I struck frae Millgye,

For Glasgow town we took our way,
When all along the road was strung,

With lads and bonnie lasses gay.
When drawing nigh I one did spy,

She was walking slowly by hersel' ;
For fear the rain would spoil her claes,

I did display my umberell'.

Where are you gaun, my bonnie lass ?

How far, then, are you gaun this way ?
To Glasgow town, sir, I am bound,

For this, you know, is feeing day.
Says I, the day seems wet to be,

Although the morning did look fine ;
Smiling, she said, I am afraid

Oh ! cheer your heart, my bonnic lass,

We'll hae guid weather by and bye,
And don't be sad when with a lad,'

A roving baker free Millgye.
And if you will accept a gill

Of whisky, brandy, rum, or wine,
We'll hae a gill, and then we will

Be in Glasgow by the feeing time.

She gave consent, and in we went

 To an alo-house that was by the way ;

Glass after glass around did pass,

 Till we baith forgot' t was feeing day.

The clock struck three, she smiled on me,

Says she, young man, the fault is thinc,
For night is on, and I'm from home,
And, besides, I've lost the fecing time.

It's lass, don't grieve, for while I live,

I nc'er intend to harm you,
For marriage I will surely try,

For baker lads they aye prove true.

Besides,  my  mither has nauc but me,
But I'll comply, and ne'er deny,
And I'll wod  before I take a fee.

Wo spent the night in merriment,

So we got married the next day,
And aye since syne my love does say,

I'm glad I lost the feeing day.
My love and I we do agree,

I ne'er do think she will repine,
For every day  she smiles and says,

I'm glad I lost the feeing time.
