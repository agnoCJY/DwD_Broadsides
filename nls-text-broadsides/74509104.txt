in consequence of which he died in great agony,


ON Monday last, the   17th instant, came on be-
fore the High Court of Justiciary, the trial of
HUGH M'MILLAN and EUPHEMIA LAWSON
or M'MILLIAN, his wife, for Murder, in so far as
they did, en the 17th of October last , throw upon
the head, face, and other parts of the body of the
now deceased Archibald Campbell, painter and teach-
er of dancing in the High Street, Edinburgh, a
quantity of sulphuric acid or corosive or burning
substance, with the intent to murder, maim, or dis-
figure the said Archibald Campbell, so that he died
in the Royal Infirmary, on the 30th of the said
month of October.

The pannels  plead not guilty  Doctors  Adams,   
Nisbett and Christison gave  evidence as to the ap- 
pearance of Campbell's body and clothes on examin-
ation in the Royal  Infirmarry and Mr Shireff  Tait  
deponed as to the deceased deposition taken by him
in the said institution, a great number of witnesses 
were then examined who stated that  vitriol, or other
corosive substance had been thrown  in Campbell's
face late on  Wednesday night, from  the house of
M'Millian.    Mrs Campbell deponed, that Mrs M'
Millian came into deceased's house that afternoon,
and threw on the floor a chair that was  laid across
the door to prevent the  child from falling down
stairs, saying------him, what was he about with his
Lawborrows now, a police officer was sent for, and
Mrs M'Millan was taken to the office, she afterwards
said I'll do for you now, several witnesses were
afterwards examined, who proved the fatal liquid
was thrown from the door of M'Millan's  house upon
the unfortunate victim of their revenge.

The Honourable Mr Leslie Melville addressed
the Jury in behalf of M'Millian, and said that he
had always maintained a good character, and that it
might be of importance to him in after life, what
their verdict should be, which he hoped would be
that of Not Guilty.

Mr Milne addressed the jury in behalf of Mrs
M'Millan, and concluded by saying that the injury
was intended for the cloak and not for the person,
and contended that he was entitled  to a verdict of
not proven.    The Lord Justice Clerk then summed
up the evidence  in his usual clear  and   impartial
manner , and  pointed out to the jury in the most
satisfactory way, that from all the circumstances,
the female prisoner  was  clearly guilty.    The jury
having retired for about fifteen minutes, returned a
verdict unanimously finding the pannel   Hugh  M'
Millan not  Guilty,  and unanimously finding the
prisoner Euphemia M' Millian guilty of the second
charge libelled in term of the late statute, but  una-
nimously and earnestly recommending her to the
mercy of the court, the verdict being engrossed,
the Lord Justice Clerk thanked the jury for their
attention, assured them their verdict was just , such    
as the court thought the evidenc warranted, and  
assured them their reconsideration  should  be duly
forwarded to the proper quarter.       

Lord Gillies and Lord  Pitmilly having delivered
their opinions, after which the Lord Justice Clerk
addresed the prisoner In a most sofemn and  im-
prassive marines nothwithstanding the recommend-
ation with which the jury accomparded their ver-
dict; nothing remained for the court but to pronounce
the last sentence of the law, even whatever might
be the result of the recommendation of the jury  it would be well	
for her to cultivate that contrition of heart and  temper of mind,
which might enable her to make-her peace with God, for she
 might lay her account with it, that even, if her life was sparred,
she would be sent out of this country.

The sentence of the court was then read, ordaining her to be
executed at the common place of execution, on Wednesday, the
23d of January next, and the husband Hugh M'Millan was dis-
missed from the bar.
