Death of the Council.

Just published, the melancholy Death of the Town Coun-
cil of the City of Edinburgh, with an account of   the
Legacy which they have left to the inhabitants at their
demise;   also the state of the Poll at Closing, giving
the names of the New Council  elected this day.

DEATH of THE Town COUNCIL.—Among the deaths of
the week, we have this day to record the demise of the
Town Council of Edinburgh. That august body has given 
up the ghost,—we wish we could say in the liberal sense,
paid the debt. The admirers of the Council, however,
will be happy to learn that it died game—that its last act
was a job,and that it shewed no symptoms of that weak-
ness known by the name of death-bed repentance. To
speak nothing but good of the dead is an admirable precept.
but one which, in the present instance,for the sake of
the living, must be violated. Had the works of the Coun- 
cil died with them, the case would have been very differ-
ent, but they have left us a little legacy, which will long
 "keep their memory green in oua souls," and we hope in
the souls of their immediate successors, as an antidote
against all jobbing in time to come. As was pretty gen-
erally anticipated, the late city rulers disregarded the pe-
tition of the inhabitants to allay the vacancy in the Trinity
College Church, occasioned by the removal of Mr Tait
to remain unfilled up until the appearance of the bill for
regulating the Annuity Tax. But we have done, and let
  us be thankful that the old corporation are at their rest,
that these incarnate jobs have gone down unwipt, un-
honoured and unsung.
