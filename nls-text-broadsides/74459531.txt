THE   CRADLES  EMPTY

BABY'S GONE.

PRICE ONE PENNY.

This Popular Song can always be had at the Poet's B
182 OVERGATE, DUNDEE.

Little empty cradle treasured now with care,

Though thy precious burden it has fled,
How we miss the locks of curly golden hair;

Peeping from thy tiny snow-white bed.
When thy dimpled cheeks and little laughing eyes,

From thy rompled pillow shone;
Then I gaxe with gladness, now I look and sigh

Empty is the cradle, baby's gone.

CHORUS.                                         

Baby's left her cradle for the golden shore,

O'er the silvery water she has flown,
Gone to join the anglels peaceful evermore,

Empty is the cradle baby's gone.
Near a shady valley, stands a grassy mound

Underneath my little darling sleeps,
Blossoms sweet and roses cluster all around,

Over head the willow silent weeps.
There I layed my loved one in the grave long ago,

And my heart doth sadly moan;
Tho' she's with the angles still I fain would weep,

Empty is the cradle, baby's gone.
