John Bull and  the Taxes!

"Here is some lines aboat the times;                
That cannot fail to please ye,       
And    if it don't, it can't be help'd,
But I dont wish to tease ye;
Go where, you will, by  day or night,
The town or  country, through,
The people cryâ€”I wonder what
Tney ever mean to do.

Go where You will, things are quite still;
Such thing were never see,sirs.
Money is wanted row you know
For the wedding of the Queen,sirs.
When Victoria went to  Parliament,
The deuce a word she said,
About the state of England.                        ! .
The Corn  Laws or the bread.
They did expect she'd something say,
Which cause 1 a pretty brother,
and  the speech was full of nonsense
From one  end to the other.

They're going to raise the mustard,
They're going to tax the gin;
They're going to tax the needles,
And they re going to tax  the pins;
They're going to tax the bonnets,
And they're going to tax the hate.  
And  they're go ng to clap a heavy tax
On pickled eels and sprats.

They re going to tax scissors.
Kettles, table-spoons and knives.

And their blooming wives
And for to raise some money for
'The wedding of the Queen,

That are turned  seventeen.

Black puddings and savoys;

For they' re  going to tax the frying-pan, 
Gridiron, tongs and bellows.

Gowns, petticoats and stays;

and They will lay a heavy duty,
On the turnip tops and greens-

And they 're going to tax the bakers,
They're going to tax the grocers.
And they're going to hang the quakers
They 're going to tax the soldiers,
And they're going to drub the sailors
And they're going to play the devil,
With the cobblers and the tailors.

And they re going to tax the swipes
They will lay a tax on a tax on hot pea soup, 
toe leather and the tripes;

And they're going to tax the cheese,
And when the sun's begun to shine
they'll tax the bugs and fleas.

They tax the ground we walk on,
They tax the bread and meat,
They're going to tax the blankets,
the balsters and the sheets,
They will lay a tax on every thing,
And keep it on the coin,
They will in future tax all children
A week before they're burn-

They're going to tax the butter,
And they're going to tax the eggs,
And they're going to tax the white hats
And tax the wooden legs;
To tax and starve the nation,

And the devil says he will tax them all
when they get into his claws.

They're going to tax the mutton.
And they going to tax the beef,
And they will tax the old women
If they have not got sharp teeth.
They will tax the donkeys,
And they will treb'e tax the horse
And they're going to tax the devil
When he comes to Glasgow Cross.
