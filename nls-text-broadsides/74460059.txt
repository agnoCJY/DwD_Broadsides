On the much Lamented Death of Mr. John Hamil-
ton, Minister of the Gospel in the Gray-friars
Parish of  Edinburgh; and sometime, formerlie
in Ireland,

COME Citizens,  and mourne with me a part?
The Righteous Perish, and few Lay't to Heart.
A Faithful Pastor is call'd now to Heaven.
Who was a shinning Light, whilst among Men;
John Baptist,   h√® might well be call'd for why!
None that came to him Unbaptis'd did Die
IRELAND may well his pious Zeal declare,
And Love he had to promote true Faith there;
Such was his Life and Doctrine 'mong the Savage
Natives thereof,  who did the Countrie Ravage,
Most Cruely its Ruins to Pressage;                        

Yet with much Mildness, He did them engage,
To yield and own,    his Message from above
Was sent,   and he an Harbinger of Love.
His Charity to all so far Extended,
That none could say, He any  e're offended
By Word or Deed,   but   endeavour'd alway,
To Recal such as Wandered Astray,                

From the Right Paths of Gods Commandments;
And brought them in by Gospel Documents
So that of  him,   it may be trulie sald.
Like John the Baptist,    He the Foundation laid
Of Righteousness somewhat into a Land,
Where ignorance Prevail'd on every Hand;
No doubt therefore his Pious Soul now sings,
Eternal praises to the King of Kings ?
And to the Lamb that sits upon the Throne,
With other Saints,   and the First Baptist John.
