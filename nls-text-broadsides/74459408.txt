Tune-Original

'Twas near the banks of bonny Tweed,
And in a flowery dell,
A rustic cottage reared its head,
The traveller knew it well;
For there a little lassie dwelt,
As fair as beauty's queen-
Not one so rare, not one so fair
As pretty Rosaline.

She was so bright, so gay, and light,
So meek and mild her mien,
Heaven's own lustre lit the eye
Of pretty Rosaline.
An aged mother-feeble-blind-
Was Rosa's only care;
Never child was half so kind,
Or parent half so dear.

To get her food she'd spin and knit,
Wi' cheerful heart, I ween,
And blind old Jenny fondly loved
Her pretty Rosaline.
Oh! how gay at close o' day,
They wandered o'er the green;
Jenny's feeble steps were led
By pretty Rosaline.

A cruel lord, so proud and base.
Sought shelter in the dell;
Enraptured with her bonny face,
He vowed-she trusted-fell!
Betray'd, despis'd, her spirits droop'd,
No more she sought the green,
But like a lily in its bloom
Died pretty Rosaline.

Her mother dear had none to cheer-
She died that very e'en-
And blind old Jenny sleeps beside
Her pretty Rosaline.
