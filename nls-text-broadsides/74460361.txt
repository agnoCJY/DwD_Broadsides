LOSS

OF THE

Benlomond

Steam Boat!

A full and particular account of the
Loss of the Benlomond Stcam Boat,
in the Firth of Forth, this morning,
when on her passage from New haven
to Alloa and Stirling.

At 9 o'clock this morning, the Benlomond Steam
Boat left the Chain Pier with a full compliment of
passengers for Alloa, Stirling and intermediate Ports,
when a short time after leaving New haven it was
discovered that the Vessel was on Fire, the conster-
nation of the passengers, were, upon discovering
the fact may be better conceived than described, but
to do bare justice, we must say, that every one on
board behaved with the greatest propriety; the fe-
male part, particularly of whom there was a great
number on board, after the first alarm was over,
conducted themselves in a manner altogether praise-
worthy and submitted to the orders and instructions
of the Captain with the most scrupulous exactness.
The Captain and crew upon the first alarm being
given, used every exertion which skill and ingenu-
ity could suggest, to stop the ravages of the flames,
but without effect, for not with standing their utmost
efforts, the raging element attained the mastery.

We noticed two Gentlemen passengers who dis-
played the greatest intrepitdity and daring in their
attempts to suppress the flames, but their names we
were not able to ascertain.

The Vessel had now reached opposite to Cram-
mond when her situation was discovered by the
people on shore, who lost no time in sending off the
Boats to their assistance, and who succeeded in land-
ing the whole Crew and passengers safe.

We understand that the Benlomond Steam Boat
belonged to Messrs Wood, of Port Glasgow, and
Napier of Glasgow, two of the most enterprising
Steam Boat Proprietors in the West of Scotland,
and the public of this city must be aware that,
owing to their exertions, the fares from New haven
to Stirling by the Benlomond was reduced from
three shillings to sixpence each passenger.
