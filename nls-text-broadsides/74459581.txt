On the Tombigby river, in a hut a born,
In a hut made of stalks of the tall yallow corn;
It was there I met with my Julia so true,
And we went for a sail in my gum-tree canoe.

CHORUS-

Row away,  row away, o'er the waters blue,
Like a feather we float in my gum-tree canoe;
Row away, row away, o'er the waters biue,
Like a feather we float in my gum-tree canoe.

With my thumb on my banjo, my foot on my oar,
I sang a sweet song to the wild water's roar;
The stars looked down on my Julia so true,
And they danced like her eyes in my gum-tree canoe.

One night we had wander'd so far, far away,
We could not get back. so we had just to stay;
We espied a big ship with a flag of true blue,
And they took us in tow in our gum-treee canoe.
