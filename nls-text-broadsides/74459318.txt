MACGREGOR'S
GATHERING.

Sung with great success by Miss G. FORRESTER.
PRICE ONE PENNY.

Copies of this Popular song, can always be had at the Poet's Box,
OVEGATE, DUNDEE.



The moon's on the lake and the mist's on brae,

And the clan has a name that is nameless by day;
The signal for fight which from monarchs we drew,
Must be heard but by night in our vengeful hallow;
Then hallow, hallow,  hallow, Grogalach.
If they rob us of name and persue us with beagles,
Give our roofs to the flames and our flesh to the eagles,
Then gather, gather, Gregalach,

while there's leaves in the forest and foam on the river,

Macgregor, despite them, shall flourish for ever.
Glenorchy's proud mountains, Kulchurn and her towers,
Clenstrae and Glenlyon no longer are oursâ€”
We're landless, landless, Gragalach.
Through the depths of Loch Katrine the steed

shall career,

O'er the peak of Ben Lomond the galley shall steer,
And the rocks of Craig Royston like icicles melt,
Ere our wrongs be forgot or our vengeanee unfelt.
Then gather, gather, Gregalach,
While there's leaves is the forest or foam on the river,
Macgregor, dspite them, shall flourish for ever.
