THE GOAST OF

BENJAMIN BINNS.

THIS  POPULAR  SONG     CAN   BE  HAD   AT   THE  POET 'S   BOX,

OVERGATE     DUNDEE.

Keep your seat if you please, and don't be afraid,
I am only a ghoast, a poor  harmless   shade;
I would not hurt any one here if I could, 
And you could't do me  much  harm  if  you  would,
Knives will not stab me  shots through me fly,
But oh! the experiment  please do not try;
It's not for yself that I care not at all,     
I' m afraid you might damage the wall
Spoken-For-----

                         CHORUS.

I'm the ghost of John James  Christophe
Benjamin Binns
I was cut down right in the midst  of my sins
For my home is down below,
I'm let out for an hour or   sow
When the cock begins to crow,
Farewell Benjamin Binns.

When I lived on this earth my wife often said- 
If I should die first she'd never get wed;
To night I called on her, through key-holes crept,
It ghoast could shed  tears I'm sure I'd have wept;
A man held  my wife in a tender embrace.
She called him her hubhy, he'd take my place;
To make matters worse, and to crown all my woes.
The fellow wearing my best Sunday cloathes.

Spoken—The gas was full on-she could  not see me, but I
was determined she should hear me  I said---"Hold! mort-
al peace of fiesh." She shrieked and held the mantel-piece.
Then I in sepulchral tones said—
				I'm the Ghost, &c.

I'll  try to forget my fals hearted wife,
And give you a plan of my present life.
I get good engagements, with cash in advance
Attending the Spiritualist's midnight seance.
I rap at the tables and kick up such scenes.
I ring clanging bells and  bang tambourines,
If  Maskeylyne  says  "Ghosts  are hosh," he is wrong,
For if he comes  near me , he'll smell  spirits quite strong.
