The Poor Man's tatties back again.


Ye working men come join with me,
And let us sing with mirth and glee ;
For noo the sang I'm gaun to sing,
Is the poor man's tatties back againâ€”
For since the year of forty-twa,          
The tattie rotted frae the shaw,
which caused baith muckle grief and pain,
But noo the tatties back again.

CHORUS.

The poor man's tatties back again,
The poor man's tatties back again,
Come let us sing till the welkin ring,
The poor man's tatties back again.

Noo the Indian buck we will eat no more
But we will have milk and spuds gallore,
And that's the stuff to fill our wame
At dinner time when we come hame ;
Noo working folks can get a feed,
O' ling and cod o' Shetland breed,
And guide salt herring frae Lochfine,
And tatties four-pence for a stane.
The poor man's tatties back again etc.

Our wifes can sit and brag wi' glee,
While drinking a strong cup o' tea,
And tatties bristled in the pan
With kitchen fee or Belfast ham,
And when the weans come frae the school
Their hungry wames they soon can fill,
With guid dry tatties roasted fine,
Noo since they have come back again.
The poor man's tatties back again.

The bits o' lasses in the toons
Are buying muffs and braw silk gowns,
And lawyers' clerks and prentice chiels,
My faith but they are looking weel,
And quickly they'll screw up their nose,
If you set them doon some guid pease brose
They will have sprats and tatties fine
Noo since they have come back again.
The poor roan's tatties back again, etc

The old farmer in the corner sits
And grins and thraws, and bites his lips,
While his wife and daughter sadly sing,
O dear the tatties baek again.
Jenny lass, you'll buy nae mair silk gowns,
Nor pianofortes io play a tune,
Or Garibaldie hats or crinolies ;
For O dear the tatties back again,
The poor man's tatties back again, etc

Our corn, our barley, and our pease,
Likewise our butter and our cheese,
And ilka thing about the toon,
In price is qnickly coming down ;
Thae trash o' trademen and their wives
Were ne'er sae braw in a' their lives
At us they tose their heads and sing
Ha, ha, the tatties back again
The poor man's tatties back again

Now Erin's sons you may rejoice,
For tatties reared them sturdy boys
On many a well fought battle plain
Englands foe they found the strenglo' tham
But since the tatties they did fail,
It caused many Irish hearts te wail,
And thousands for it left their home,
But huzza, the tatties back again,
Tha poor man's tatties back again, etc

Noo working folk see and be wise,
When things is cheap, tak my advice,
From public houses do abstain,
And thar's the way your sure to gain.
Their trash o' whisky end their yill,
Your hungrk wames it ne'er can fill,
But beef and tatties do buy in,
And hunger then you ue'er will fin'
The poor man's tatties back again, etc
