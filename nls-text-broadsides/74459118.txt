BURNS AND HIGHLAND MARY.

In green Caledonia there ne'er were two lovers, 
Sae enraptured and happy in each others arms,
As Burns the sweet bard and his dear Highland Mary And fondly and sweetly he sang of her charms. 
And lang will his sang sae enchanting and bonnie
Be heard with delight on his dear native plains,
And lang will the name of his dear Highland Mary, 
Be secred to love in his heart-melting strains.

O' twas a May day, and the flowers o' the simmer Were blooming in wildness a' lovely and fair;          
That our twa lovers mot in a grove o' green bowers Which grew on the banks of the clear winding Ayr. 
And oh, to them baith 'twas a meeting fu' tender, As it was the last for a while the would haeâ€”
Till the red setting sun showed the close o' the day. 
Oh ! Mary, dear Mary, exclaimed her fond lover Ye carry my heart to the highlands with thee ;
Every burnie aud bank every grove and  green bower,
May talk o'the love o'my lassie and me;
My life's sweetest treasure my ain charming Mary, 
To thee I'll be ever devoted and true ; 
For the heart that is berring sae fast in this bosom, 
The heart that can never love any but you. 
Oh ! dinna bide lang in the Highlands my Mary. 
Oh ! dinna bide lang in the Highlands frae me, 
For l love these sincerely I love thee ow're dearly, 
To be happy so far my dear Mary, from thee.
I winna bide lang my dear lad in the Highlands,
I canna bide lang for ye winna be there
Although I hae friends I like weel in the High ands,
The ane I love best's on the banks o' the ayr.
Then he kissed her red lips thev were sweeter than roses,
And he strained her lily-white breast to his heart,
And her tears fell like dew-drops at e'en on his bosom,
As she said my fond lover, alas! we maun part.
Then farewell ho said, an' he flew frae his Mary,
Oh ! farewell said Mary, she could sae nae mair ;
Oh ! little they kenned they had parted for ever,
When they parted that night on the banks o' the Ayr.

Yet the green summer saw but a few sunny mornings ,
Till she, in the bloom of her beauty and pride,
Was laid in her grave , like a bonny young flower,
In Greenock Kirk Yard, on the banks o' the Clyde ;
And Burns the sweet bard of his ain Caledonia,
Lamented his Mary in many a sad strain. 
Ah ! sair did he weep for his dear Highland Mary, 
And ne'er did his heart love sae deeply again. 
Then bring me the lilies and bring me the roses, 
And bring me the daisies that grow on the vale ;
And bring me the breath of the sweet seented gale,
And bring me the sigh of a fond lovers bosom,
And bring me the tear of a fond lovers e'e,
And I'll pour them down on thy gravo Highland Mary,
For the sake o'  thy Burns what owre dearly loved thee.
