AN

ELEGIE,

ON,

The never enough to be lamented Death,

O   F
The Reverend Mr. William Delape Preacher of the Gospel,

WHO

Departed this Life October 30, 1720.
Aged 28 Yeats,

O Great, eternal, high and mighty One,
Who doth command all Flesh before thy Throne,
Not at our Times, nor Seasons it must be,
But when thou'rt pleas'd to give the high Decree,
For thou art he who on us doth bestow
All temp'ral Blessings which, are here below.
And as we prize them so thou can allow
The Use of them, and take them from us too.

O Edinburgh did thou behold and see
Thy mighty Loss, and thy great Misery,
Thou might condole thy Scarr in Floods of Tears,
But thou'rt regardless and it seems not fears
Such mighty Blows altho they're double thrown,
Such weighty Stroaks, that Enemies must own,
The Church hath lost a Pillar of Renown,
For they do own his Learning great and rare,
His Conversation and his Walking square,
But who is he that can withstand the Dart
Of this cruel Tyrant, when he doth attempt
To give the fatal Blow,'tis sure none can
Withstand this mighty Conquerer of Man.
Nor Youth nor Strength, no Rank, yea no Degree;
But who must subject be to his Decree.
But happy he who from his Dart is free;
He enjoys GOD with all Felicity.
Now he doth sing, from all his Sins he's free.
And he doth praise GOD to Eternity.
