An Excellent new Song much in Request,
intituled, My Wife shall have her Will

To'its own Proper new Tune

ALL you that would hear of a merry Je
Come listen to what I say :              st,
For a Woman to have her Will is best,
and always to bear the Sway.

And if you would lead a contented Life,
pray give her, Humer   still,
And that you shall rest, and I hold it best
that my Wife shall have her   Will

If I unto an Ale-House go ?
for to drink with any Friend,
If my sweet Wife be not with me
then for Her I will send.

' Tis for my sweet Wife I will call
and bid Her drink her Fill.
But if she say she'll drink none at all   
I'll let her have her Will.

I'll buy the best Meat for my sweet Wife,
that the Mercat can afford,
I'll send it home for to be dress :
and I'll set it on the Board.

Then for my sweet Wife I will call
and bid her eat her Fill,
But if she says she'll eat none at all
my Wife shall have her Will.

And if my Wife hath a mind to ride 
for to visit any Friend,
A Horse for her I will provide
and a Man for to attend.

A Horse for her I will provide
and so I will do still:
But if she sayes she'll go  on Foot,
my Wife shall have  her  Will.

And if my Wife doth prove with Chid,
as seldom yet hath been.
A Nurse and Mid-Wife I will provide ;
and all Things neat and trim.

Rich Cakes and Wines I will provide,
and so I will do still
But if she sayes she'll save the Charge's
I'll let her have her Will.

But there's one Thing I remember yet,
and there' s one Thing I forgot :
Sometimes my Wife shall have her Will
and sometimes she shall not.

But if I could hear my Wife once say
she would wear her old Cloaths still,
Then that shall rest, and I hold it best ;
that my Wife shall have her Will.

And if my Wifea Gossoping go,
and play the Wanton still:
And that I think it is not fit
my Wife should have her Will.
