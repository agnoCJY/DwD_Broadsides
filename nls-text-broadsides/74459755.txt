TUNEâ€”Original.

Sit ye down here, my cronies, and gie us your crack,
Let the wind tak the care o' this life on its back ;
Our hearts to despondency we never will submit,
For we've aye been provided for, and sae will we yet.
	And sae will we yet, &c.

Let the miser delight in the hoarding of pelf,
Since he has not the soul to enjoy it himself;
Since the bounty of Providence is new every day,
As we journey through life let us live by the way.
	Let us live by the way, &c.

Then bring us a tankard o' nappy guid ale,
For to comfort our hearts and enliven the tale ;
We'll aye be the merrier the langer we sit,
For we've drunk thegither mony a time, and sae will we
yet.
	And sae will we yet, &c.

Success to the farmer, and prosper his plough,
Rewarding his eident toils a' the year through ;
Our seed-time and harvest we ever will get,
For we've lippened aye to Providence, and sae will we yet.
	And sae will we yet, &c.

Long live the Queen, and happy may she be,
And success to her forces by land and by sea;
Her enemies to triumph we never will permit,
Britons aye have been victorious, and sae will they yet.
	And sae will they yet, &c.

Let the glass keep its course, and go merrily round,
For the sun has to rise, though the moon it goes down ;
Till the house be rinnin' round about, it's time enough
to flit,
When we fell, we aye got up again, and sae will we yet.
	And sae will we yet, &c.
