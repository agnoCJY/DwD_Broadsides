THE GRAND ASCENDENCY.

AIR." This is no mine ain house."

Oh ! this is now our ain house,
Cleanse it frae vermin a',
Lea' na in our ain house
One reptile on the wal.

Lang hae we sigh'd—lang hae we pray'd,
For those in pow'r to gie us aid,
But still the ruthless tyrants said—
We'll keep the grand ascendency.
Oh ! this is now, &c.

Wi' base intrigues the State and Kirk
Hae carried on their dirty wark,
And while we hunker'd in the dark—
They keepit the ascendency.
Oh ! this is now, &c.

Wi' banishment to distant isles,
Wi' fines at hame, and loathsome jails,
Wi' gibbets, blocks, and fiery piles—    
They keepit the ascendency.
Oh ! this is now, &c.

But wearied wi' distresses dire
We raised our arms to heaven's sire,
And swore that we would a' expire,
Or hae the grand ascendency.
Oh ! this is now, &c.

The Unions then in millions join'd;
The rich man, wi' the poor combin'd
And now our standards float on wind,
And we've the grand ascendency.
Oh ! this is now, &c.

CALDWELL,   PRINTER.
