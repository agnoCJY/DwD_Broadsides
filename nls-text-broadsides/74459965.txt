A    BALLAD

BY   AN   INGENIOUS   YOUTH,

           

As the Laird o' Glentosh was haudin' hame,
Astride o' his nit brown steed, 
Up came muckle Macpherson Rab,
Talking o' bleaching thread, thread, thread—
Bleth'rin' bout bleaching thread.

The Laird counsell'd Rab for to tak' care, 
As he was blam'd for sawin' seed,
And that poor Jean Roy had suffer'd sair
By his cracking her maiden head, head, head—
By his smashing her maiden head.

He advised him the parish to leave,
And give up the bleaching o' thread,
And gang to some spot whaur.chiels sic as him
The population stood in need, need, need—
The kintra stood in need.

For his size and the shape o' his weel-fill'd breeks,
The women would glegly foresee,
Had ordain'd him the sex to fructify,
Wherever he might be, be, be—
Where'er he'd chance to be.

Rab took the advice---- at least he's awa
As a molecatcher 'yont the Clyde,
Whaur, dootless, the wives and the lasses a'
Are praying he lang may abide, bide, bide—
Are praying he aye may abide.
