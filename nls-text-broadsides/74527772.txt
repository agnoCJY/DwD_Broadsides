BONNY LIZIE BALIE.
A New SONG very much in Request,

IT fell about the Lambmass Tide      
When the Leaves were fresh & green,
Lizie Bailie is to Gartartain                  
to see her Sifter Jean.
She had not been in Gartartain,           
even but a little while,
Till Luck and Fortune happen'd her, 
and she went to the Isle,

And when she went into the Isle.         
She met with Duncan Grahame,
So bravely as he courted her,              
and he convey'd her hame:
My bonny Lizie Bailie                        
I'll row thee in my Pladie,
If thou will go along with me              
and be my Highland Lady.

If I would go along with thee              
I think I were nor Wise,
For I cannot milk Cow nor Ewe,        
nor yet can I speak Erse.
Hold thy Tongue bonny Lizie Bailiet
and hold thy Tongue, said he.
For any thing that thou does lack
My Dear I'll learn thee.

She would not have a Low-land Laird
he wears the high heal'd Shoes, 
she will Marry Duncan Grahame
for Duncan wears his Trews;
She would not have a Gentleman.
a Farmer in Kilsyth
But she would have the Highland-man,
he lives into Monteith:

She would not have the Low-land man,
nor yet the English Laddie,
But she would have the Highland man,
to row her in his Pladie.
He took her by the milk-white han
and he convoy'd her hame,
And still she thought both Night and Day
on bonny Duncan Grahame 
     
O bonny Duncan Grahame
why should ye me miscarry
For if you have a love for me
we'll meet at Castle carry
As I came in by Dennie Bridge,
and by the Holland-Bush,
My Mother took from me my Cloaths
my Rings ay and my Purse,

Hold your Tongue my Mother Dear,
for that I do not care;
For I will go with Duncan Grahame
tho' I should ne'r get mair:
For first when I met Duncan Grahame
I met with meikle Joy,
And many Pretty High-land Men
was there at my Convoy

And he is gone through the Muir
and she is through Glen,
O bonny Lizie Bailie
when will we meet again.
Shame light on these Loger-heads
that lives in Castle carry
That let away the bonny Lass
the Highland Man to Marry,

O bonny Lizie stay at home,
thy Mother cannot want thee,
For any thing that thou does lack
my Dear I'll cause get thee,
I would not give my Duncan Grahame
for all my Father's Land.
Altho he had three Lairdships more
and all at my Command.

Now She's cast off her silken Gowns
that she wear'd in the Lowland.
And she's up to the Highland Hills
to wear Gowns of Tartain.
And she's cast off her high heel'd shoes
was made of the gilded Leather,
And she's up to Gillecrankie
to go among the Heather.

And she's cast off her high-heel'd Shoes
and put on a pair of laigh ones,
and she's away with Duncan Grahame
to go among the Brachans,
O my bonny Lizie Bailie
thy Mother cannot want thee
And if thou go with Duncan Grahame
thou'll be a Gillecrankie.

Hold your Tongue my Mother dear,
and folly let thee be,
Should not I fancie Duncan Grahame
when Duncan fancies me:
Hold your Tongue my Father dear
and folly let thee be,
for I will go with Duncan Grahame
before all the Man I see;

Who is it that's done this Turn?
who has done this Deed?
A Minister it's Father she says,
lives at the Rugh-burn-bridge.
A Minister Daughter he says,
A Minister for Mister.
O hold your Tongue my Father dear
he Married first my Sister.

O fair ye well my Daughter dear,
dearly as I lov'd thee, 
Since thou wilt go to Duncan Grahame
my bonny Lizie Bailie;
O fare you well my Father dear,
also my Sister Betty,
O fare you well my Mother dear
I leave you all compleatly.

FINIS.
