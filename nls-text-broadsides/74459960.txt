The Lord Advocate's Address to
Auld Reekie's Sons,

Whose display of talent and independent
spirit has been so long established in this his
native city ; it is therefore beyond all doubt
he will succeed as one of her Representatives :
His magnanimity of mind, and his stedfast
adherence to sound principles, entitle him to
your generous voice. Only think on BRUCE
and WALLACE ! they fought with sword in
hand-he fights with words and pen ! Recd
the Edinburgh Review !                 W. G.

SONG.

FRANCIS JEFFREY.

TUNE—Johnny Cope.

OH ! JEFFREY, welcome to your town,
She prays an' greets you as a boon ;
Altho' you swore by Willie's crown,
We wish you luck some morning.

O if I had ten thousand votes,
The air as thick as autumn's motes,
My pocckets fu' o' Willie's notes,*
I'd gie them a' for Jeffrey.

Some fo'k hae dared to speak o' you,
They said to Scotland you was not true;
May they be d------d the silly crew,
Wha wou'd despise our Jeffrey.

He ever was Auld Reekie's friend,
His deeds will show—how big his mind,
His soul with virtue is well lined,
The chief o' chiefs, Frank Jeffrey.

For me to paint him as our chief,
For GOD SAKE, read his letter brief;
May he ne'er thrive, the cruel thief,
That would oppose our Jeffrey,

Ye, Pounders Ten, come join wi' me,
And drink success by three times three ;
He is our Member we agree,
The star o' stars, Frank Jeffrey !
