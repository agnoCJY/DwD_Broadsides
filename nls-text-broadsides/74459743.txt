Trust to luck, trust to luck, and stare fate in the face,
Sure the heart must be easy if it's in the right place;
Let the world wag away, let your friends turn to foes,
Let your pockets run dry, and threadbare your clothes.
Should woman deceive you, ne'er trust to their hearts,
Never sigh, 'twon't relieve you, but only cause smart;
Trust to luck, trust to luck, and stare fate in the face,
Sure the heart must be easy if it's in the right place.

Be a man, be a man wherever you go,
Through the sunshine of wealth and the tear-drop of woe;
Should the wealthy look grand or the friend pass you by
With a beck of their hand and disdain in their eye,
Snap your fingers and smile as you go on your way,
And remember the while every dog has his day;
Trust to luck, trust to luck, and stare fate in the face,
Sure the heart must be easy if it's in the right place.

In love or in war, sure, we Irish delight,
We are good-humoured with both, a swate girl or a fight;
We blarney, we bother, we coaxes the dears,
To resist us they can't, but they're off when we're near.
When war-time it comes, for our darlings we sigh,
And for liberty fight, and for ould Ireland we die;
Trust to luck, trust to luck, and stare fate in the face,
Sure the heart must be easy if it's in the right place.
