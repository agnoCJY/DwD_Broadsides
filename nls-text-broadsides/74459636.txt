Thenew way of the bonny High,
land Laddie, &c.

To it's own Proper Tune, &c.

I   Crossed   Forth, I  Crossed Tay,
I left Dundee, and Edinborrow,
I saw   nothing there, was worth my stay,
And so I had theus  all Good-morrow.
Omy bonny bonny highland laddie,
Omy bonny bonny highland laddie,
When I'm sick and like to dye
Thou'lt row me in thy highland pladie.

For on the Cairna'mount I spy'd
in careless dress  a Highland  Laddie,

Whobriskly said, were't  thou my Briae,,
Pde  row thee in my Highland Pladdie.
O my bonny bonny, &c

No Butter-Box he seem'd to be,

no English-Fop,  nor Lowland Laddie,

But by his meiu he was well known,,
to be some Gentie Highland Laddie,
O my bonny bonny, &c.

His  Quiver hang down by bis Thigh,
his  Mein did show his  Bow was ready,

A thousand Darts flew from his Eye,
and all fell down before his Lady.
O my bonny bonny, &c.

It's Silken Rooms and  Pearled Beds,
and laced Shooes f it for a Lady ;

But he can do't  as wantonly,

in Highland Trews and a belied Plaidie
O my  bonny bonny &c.

I will have no Commander Mar

Captain, Col'nel, nor a Caddie,
If all my friends had sworn and said,

Ple  have none but a Highland   Laddie,
O my bonny bonny, &c.

But  when' we came to Stirling  Town,
he promis'd to make me a Lady,

But all the Tochar that I got,

he row'd  me in his Highland Plaidie,

O my  bonny bonny highland Laddie,

O my, bonny bonny highland Laddie,
When I am sick and like to dye,

he'l row me in his Highland Plaidie.
