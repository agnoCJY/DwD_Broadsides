A Full and Particular Account of the Trial and Sea-
tence of HUGH M'MILLAN, and EUPHEMIA
M'MILLAN, this last of whom is to be Executed
at Edinburgh on Wednesday the 23d January,
1828, for the Murder of Archibald Campbell.
Teacher of Dancing in Edinburgh, by throwing
Vitriol in his face, in consequence of which he
died in great agony.

ON Monday last, the 17th instant, came on be-
 fore the High Court of Justiciary, the trial of
Hugh M'Millan, and Euphemia Lawson, or M'-
Millian, his wife, for murder, in so far as they did,
en the 17th of October last, throw upon the head,
face, and other parts of the body, of the now de-
ceased Archibald Campbell, Painter, and Teacher
of Dancing, in the High Street, of Edinburgh, a
quantity of sulphuric acid or other corosive or burn-
ing substance, with the intent to murder, maim, or
disfigure the said Archibald Campbell, so that he
died in the Royal Infirmrry, on the 30th of the
said month of October.

The pannels both pled not guilty, Doctors Adams,
Nisbett, arid Christison, gave evidence as to the ap-
pearance of Campbell's body and clothes on examin-
ation in the Royal Infirmary, and Mr Sheriff Tait
deponed as to the deceased's disposition taken by
him in the said institution, a great number of wit-
taesses were then esamined, who stated that vitriol
or other corosive substance had been thrown in
Campbell's face late on Wednesday night, from the
house of M'Millian. Mrs Campbell deponed that
Mrs M'Millian came into the deceased's house that
afternoon, and threw on the floor a chair that was
laid across the door to prevent the child from fall-
ing down stairs, saying-----him, what was he ab-
out with his lauburrows. Now a Police Officer
was sent for, and Mrs M'Millian was taken to the
Office, she afterwards said I'll do for you now, se-
veral other witnesses were, afterwards examined,
who proved the fatal liquid was thrown from the
door of M'Millian's house upon the unfortunate
victim of their revenge.

The Honourable Mr Leslie addressed the Jury
on behalf of M'Millian, and said that he had al-

ways maintained a good character, and that it might,
be of importance to him in after life, what heirt
verdict should be, whcih he hoped would be that of
not guilty.

Mr Milne addressed the Jury in behalf of Mrs
M'Millian, and continued by saying that the in-
jury was intended for the cloak and not for the
person, and contended that he was entitled to a
verdict of not proven. The Lord Justice Clerk then
summed up the evidence, in his usual clean and
impartial manner, and pointed out to the Jury in
the most satisfactory way, that from all the circum-
stances, the female prisoner was clearly guilty.
The  Jury having retired for about fifteen minutes,
returned a verdict  unanimously finding the pannel
Hugh M'Millian not guilty, and unanimously find-
ing the prisoner Euphennia M'Millian guilty of the
second charge libelled in terms of the late  statue,
but unanimously and earnestly recommending her
to the mercy of the court, the verdict being engross'd,
the Lord Justice Clerk thanked the Jury for their
attention, assured them their recommendation should
be duly forwarded to the proper quarter.

Lords Gillies and Pitmilly having delivered their
opinion, after which the Lord Justice Clerk address-
ed the prisoner in a most solemn and impressive
manner, notwithstanding the recommendtaion with
which the jury had accompained their verdict,
nothing remained for the court but to pronounce

the last sentence of  the law, even whatever might be the result
of the recommendation of the Jury, it would be well for her to
cultivate that contrition of heart and temper of mind which
might enable her to make her peace with God, far she might
lay her account with it, that even if her life was spared she would
be sent out of this country.

The sentence of the Court was then read, ordering nor to be,
executed at the common place of execution, on Wednesday the
23d day of January next, and the Husband Hugh M'Millian
was dismissed from the bar.
