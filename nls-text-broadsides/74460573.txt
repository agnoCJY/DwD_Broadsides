TO THE        

Prospective Electors

OF

ROXBURGHSHIRE.

IT appears that LORD JOHN SCOTT'S friends are giving it
out that he is a REFORMER ! with the view it is supposed of catch-
ing a few stray Votes. But this won't do. It is not yet forgotten
that Lord JOHN attended a Meeting of Freeholders, &c. at JEDBURGH,
on 21st March, 1831, when he voted out and out against the REFORM
BILLS, and signed petitions to both Houses of Parliament praying
that they might not pass into a law.          .
	
THE County Records therefore prove that Lord JOHN is a
DECIDED ANTI-REFORMER, and he is supported alone by that
party in the County. The object of the Anti-Reformers is to trip up
the present enlightened Government, to which you are indebted for
the Elective Franchise. Your object should be to support that Go-
vernment at least by your first Vote, to shew your gratitude for the
privilege conferred on you. This you can only do by voting for the
HON. CAPT. GEORGE ELLIOT, who is a Member of the Govern-
ment to which you owe so much, and a Gentleman well qualified by
his talents and experience to represent you in Parliament. How can
the Anti-Reformers ask your Vote for Lord JOHN SCOTT, when they
did every thing in their power to prevent you from having a Vote to
give ? The most of you are already expressly pledged, and all of
you are bound by your principles to vote -for a Reformer, Who will
support the present Government : and there is now no doubt what-
ever, that CAPT. ELLIOT, who has just arrived from LONDON, will be
returned by an overwhelming and triumphant majority.
