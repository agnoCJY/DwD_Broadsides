THE

ORPHAN BOY.

BY JOHN WILSON, GLASGOW.

I hear the people sing about the Drunkard's raggit
	wean,                                   alane,
As I wander through the streets, quite dejected &
Baith hungry, cauld, and raggit, and nae frien's
	at a' hae I;                                Boy.
And oh! there's few to pity me, a puir wee Orphan
But ance I kent a faither's love, and a mither's ten
	der care,                                   share,
To soothe my wee bit sorrows, and my infant joy to
But noo, beneath the cauld clay, in you kirk-yard 
	they lie;                                    Boy.
And noo I wander, quite forlorn, a puir wee Orphan

Wi' scarce a rag upon my back, or shoon upon my
	feet,                                          sleet
Exposed to ilka cauld blast, the hail, the rain, and
And often dreepit to the skin upon some stair I lie;
For oh! there's nane to shelter me a puir wee Orp-
	han Boy.                                   piece,
And often, when I'm hungry, and gangs to seek a
The folk dae tak' me for a thief, and threaten the
	Police,                                    faint am I;
Ithers turn me rudely frae their door while weak &
But oh! I ken I mauna steal, though I'm an Orp-
	han Boy.

And often I've been glad, ither happy weans to see
Playin' in the streets, wi' their hearts a' fu' o' glee
I've quite forgot my sorrows, as I stood to see their
	joy:                               Orphan Boy.
And oh! there's nane o' them like me, a puir wee
O surely they are happy weans, wha hae their par-
	ents' dear                            to cheer:
To find them every comforts, and their little heart
But I'll put my trust in Him abune, wha hears the
	orphan's cry:                         Orphan Boy
He's the only fren' that can protect the puir wee
