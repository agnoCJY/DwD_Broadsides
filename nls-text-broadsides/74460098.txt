the Cross, the result of the polling
and ultimate return of the Lord Ad-

they will take leave of the members

not been attended with a single act

KARKCALDY.—On Tuesday
the election for this district
took place at Kirkcaldy, and
was unfortunately attended
with a serious accident.
The Sherift having read the
writ and the act against brib-
bery and corruption,
Provost Malcolm of Kirk-
caldy rose and proposed Mr
Ferguson of Raith as a fit and
proper person to represent
this district of burghs in par-
liament,and therefore nomin-
ated him accordingly.
Provost White of Kinghorn
said that he had much satis-
f'action in seconding the mo-
tion.
The Sherift then declared
Mr Ferguson duly elected;
and he was about to address
the electors, when the hust-
ings suddenly gave way, and
fell on several boys who were
below, one of whom was kil-
led, and another so severely
bruised, that his life is de-
spaired of ; several others re-
ceived contusions, and we un-
derstand that several gentle-
men on the hustings were also
hurt.
Mr Ferguson afterwards ad-
dressed the audience from a
window, expressing his pain.
ful feelings on thismelancholy
and distressing occasion.
