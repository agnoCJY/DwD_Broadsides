THEY WERE THERE

This Popular Song can always be had at the Poet's Box,
224 Overgate, Dundee.

I'm a very absent-minded man,

I'll have you understand,
I might be looking for a thing

And have it in my hand;
Last night to find my spectacles

I searched with all my eyes,
Then stopp'd a bit to wipe my brow,

When to my great surprise—

CHORUS

They were there ! they were there !

Yes, I really do declare,

Now wasn't that a singular affair,

For them I searched in vain,

And I'd do the same again,

'Pon my word it never struck me they'd be there.

My wife went out some hours ago

To get some things for tea,

I soon began to wonder

Where the mischief she could be;
Through all the likely places,I,

Did search till I was tired,
Thinks I perhaps she'll be in jail,

CHORUS

And she was there! she was there!

Yes, I really do declare;

Now wasn't that a comical affair,

Yes and there she will remain

Till they let her out again,

But I'm all right when I know that she is there

Last Sunday morn I couldn't find
My dress suit to put on,

I asked the missus where it was,

Said she, I'll tell you John,

Do you know that place of business

Where the three brass balls hang out,
I said I did, said she, oh then—

Don't put yourself about~

CHORUS

for its there ! yes its there!

Yess I really do declare

I tell you 'tisnt any other where

Yes, and there it will remain

Till you take It out-again,

But you're all right when you know that it is there

The woman next door where I live,

For months has paid no rent,
The landlord couldn't find her in,

No matter when he went.
One day he Called as usual,

She's not in, the daughter said,
But the landlord stepped into the house

And peep'd beneath the bed—

CHORUS

And she was there! she was there!
Yes, I really do declare
Now wasn't that a comical affair,
For the landlord, there's no doubt.
Found her to, and found her out,

Now wonder how he tumbled she was there.
