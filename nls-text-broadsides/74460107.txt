CURIOUS LOVE LETTERS

FROM A                                                 

Gentleman to a Lady.          

MADAM,

The great love and tenderness I have hitherto expressed for you
is false. And I now feel that my indifference towards you
increases porportionably every day. And the more I see you
the more you appear rediculous, and an object of contempt, and
the more I feel disposed, inclined, and finally determined, to
hate you.—Believe me I naver had the least inclination to
offer   yon my hand and   heart------Our last   conversation  has
I assure you, left a wretched insipidity, which has by no means
possessed me with the most exalted opinion of your character.
Yes, madam, and you will much oblige me, by avoiding me.
And if evar we are united, I shall experiencs nothing but the
fearful hatred of my parents, added to an everlasting dis-
pleasure of living with you. Yes, madam, I think sincerely -
You need not put yourself to the smallest trouble or send or
write me an  answer------Adieu.    And   believe me that I  are
so a verse to you, that it is really impossible I shuld ever be.

		Madam,
	Your sffectionate  lever till death,

				W. GOFF.
To Miss M. Wi--------ms.

This curious and very ingenious  love letter dropped form the
pocket of a young gentleman who is well known in the sporting
circle, was picked up by a matron of this town, and would in all
probability have been for ever in oblivion, had it not been given
to the present publisher, who determined to have it printed for the
amusement and information of all young bachelors, There are
two ways-of reading it; her father compelled his daughter to show
him all letters sent to her—the unsuspecting father reads straight
forward, but the daughter (having the clew) reads the 1st. 3rd.
and 5th. lines, and so on , then the contrast will be discovered.
