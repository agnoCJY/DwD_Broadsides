William and Herriet.

There was a rich gentleman in Glasgow did dwell,
He had a lovely daughter a sailor loved well;
Because she was handsome and loved him so true,
Her father he wanted her to bid him adieu.

O  father, dear father, I'm not so inclined,
To drive my young sailor quite out of my mind ;
O, then unruly daughter confined you shall be,
And I'll send your young sailor far over the sea.

It's she was sitting in her bower one day,
Awaiting for William she was hard for to say ;
She sang like a linnet and appeared like a dove,
And the song that she sang was coneerning her love,

She had not long been there when William pass'd by,
And on his dearest Herriet he east a longing eye;
He says your cruel father with mine has agreed,
For to send me a sailing far over the sea.

She says my sweet William with you I will go,
Since my cruel father has served me so ;
I will pass for your shipmate and do what I can,
With my William I'll venture like a, jolly young man.

She dress'd like a sailor as near as could be,
And they both went together across the salt sea ;
They both went together to some foreign shore,
But they never did to Glasgow returned any more.

For as they were a sailing by some foreign shore,
The wind from the ocean began for to roar ;
The ship she went down to the bottom of the sea,
So cast upon an island was William and she.

They rambled together some place for to spy,
They had nothiug for to eat, and nowhere to lie ;
So they lay down together upon the cold ground,
While the waves and the tempest madea terrible sound,

Then hunger came on them and death drawmg nigh,
They folded together intending to die ;
What pair could bo bolder to bid this world adieu,
So now they are mouldering like lovers so true.
