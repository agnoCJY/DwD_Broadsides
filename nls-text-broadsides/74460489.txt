THE

FISHERMAN'S

GIRL.

Down in the Country
A poor girl did wander,
Down in the Country
A poor girl did roam,
She belongs to this nation.
She has lost each dear relation.
She's a poor little Fisherman's girl,
Whose friends are dead and gone.

O who has a kind heart
To give me a shelter,
Or who has a kind heart
To give me a home,
I have no father or mother,
I have a tender brother,
Cried the poor little Fisherman's girl,
Whose friends are dead and gone.

I once had a home
And my friends reared me tender,
I passed with my brother
Each happy night and morn,
But death has made a slaughter,
My father's in the water
Cried the poor little Fisherman's girl,
Whose friends are dead and gone.

O fast falls the snow
I've got no place for shelter,
O fast falls the snow
I must hasten to the thorn.
Where my covering is the bushes,
An'd my bed is the green rushes,
Cried the poor little Fisherman's girl,
Whose friends are dead and gone.

O she happened to stray
By a very noble mansion,
A gentleman who heard her,
His heart for her did burn.
He said my poor young creature
As he viewed each drooping feature,
You are my poor little fisherman's girl
Whose friends are dead and gone.

He took her to the fire
Where he warmed her and fed her,
As the tears began to flow
He fell on her breast forlorn,
Saying live with me for ever
We part again no never,
You are my own dear sister,
Whose friends are dead and gone.

Now she has got a home,
And she lives with her brother,
Now she has got a home,
And the needy ne'er does scorn,
Providence was her protector            
Likewise the kind conductor,
Of the poor little Fisherman's girl,
Whose friends were dead and gone.
