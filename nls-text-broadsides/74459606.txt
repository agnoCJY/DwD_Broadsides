Fair is the morn in flowery May,
And sweet is night in autumn, mild,
When roving through the garden gay,
Or wandering in the lonely wild;
but woman, nature's darling child,
There all her charms she dose foiled
Even there her other works are foiled
By the bonnie lass o' Ballochmyle.
Even there her other works are foiled.
By the bounie lass o' Ballochmyle.

By the bonnie lass o' Balloohmyle,
By the bonnie lass,
By the bonnie, bonnie lass,
By the bounie lass o' Ballochmyle.

O, had she been a country maid,
And I the happy country swa:n,
Though sheltered in the lowest shed
That ever rose on Scotland's plain;
Through weary winter's wind and rain,
With joy, with rapture, I would toil,
And nighty to my bosom strain
The bonnie lass o' Ballochmyle.
And nighty to my bosom strain
The bonnie lass o' Ballochmyle.

The bonnie lass o' Ballochmyle,
The bouuie lass,
The bonnie, bonnie lass,
The bonnie lass o' Ballochmyle.
