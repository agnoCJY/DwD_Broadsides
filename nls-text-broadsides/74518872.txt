ALLAN WATER:
OR, A LOVER IN CAPTIVITY

A   NEW   SONG:
Sung with a pleasant New Air

Allan Water's wide and deep,
and my dear Anny's very bonny;
Wides the Straith that lyes above't,
if't were mine I'de give it all for Anny;
But why, O why should she disdain,
since my Heart's Love to her I carry
Tho I had a Thousand Hearts in one
unshar'd I'de give them all to Anny.

Her Countenance and her black Hair
first captiv'd me, and then like Thunder
She disappear'd and ruin'd me, 
and my poor Heart's quite burnt to Tinder,
But why, O why should I disspair?
for sure the gods to pity will move her.
And send her this Heart of mine,
some cooling Balsom so deliver.

Dear Amy wilt thou look and see,
and sure I am thou'll take compassion
On this poor Heart that mourns for thee,
such love alas is out of fashion,
All Day I wish, all Night I sigh,
and still I hope to find her changed,
But ah, alas all is in vain,
for sure my Ruine is designed,
FINIS.
