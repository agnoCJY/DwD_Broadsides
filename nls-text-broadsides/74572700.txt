Ranty, Tanty.

Nansiy's to the Green-Wood gane,
To hear the Lintwhite chattring
And Willie's follow'd  her alane;
To gain her Love by flattring.
But all that he could do or say,
She snuf't and sneerd at him,
And ay when he began to Woe,
She bad him mind wha gat him.                                    

What ails you at my Dad quoth he
My Minny or my Aunty
With Craudy Maudy they fed me,
Lang-Kail and Ranty, Tanty.
With Bannocks of good Barly-Meal
of that there was right Plenty,
And chapped Kail butter'd  full well,
And was not that right dainty.

Altho' my Dady was no Laird,
I speak it without Vaunty,
He had a House and a good Kail-yard
A Hall House and a Pantry.
A good Blew Bonnet on his Head,
A Roll about his Craigie,
And ay unto the Day he died,
He rode on good shanks Nagy,

Then Nansie turn'd her round about
With great Disdain and Scorn.
And Willie he stood out about,
As he had been forlorn.
Now wae and wander on your Snout
would ye have bonny Nansie,
Would you compare your self to me
A Doken to a Tansie.

Go get you gone Gib Glaiks she says,
John Gibblets with some other,
Or then I fear you'l get your Pakes
Go give the Nolt their fodder.
I have a young Son of my awn,
They call him souple Saunny.
And well a watt his bonny Mow,
Is sweet as  Sugar-Candie,

FINIS
