I LOVE THE BONNIE
LASSES.

Copies of this popular song can always be had the POET''S Box,
Overgate, Dundee.

Some poets always sing in praise of bright and sparkling

wine,

And say there's pleasure in the foaming glass;
Well, they may take the wine, for there's something

more devine
In the smiling of a bonnie, bonnie lass.

CHORUS

I love the lasses, the bonnie, bonnie lasses,

I love the lasses short or tall;
Whether dark or fair be the colour of their hair,

I love the bonnie lasses, bless them all;

When fortune smiles upon us and the world all

seems fair,
What can make our lives in pleasure pass, 

Or soothe us if the hour should come of sorrow  and

of care,
Like the smiling of a bonnie,. donnie lass?

Look at poor old grannie with the children on her knee,
May her few short years of life in comfort pass,

Though she's old and feeble now, and there's wrinkles

on her brow,
Yet once she was a bonnie, bonnie lass.

Then here's to every mother, and every sister  dear,
And while the sands of time run in the glass,

Let the toast of our lives be our sweethearts and our

wives,
And success to every bonnie, bonnie lass.
