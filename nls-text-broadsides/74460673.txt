A Letter from a Gentleman in Forfar,
to his Friend at Edinburgh.

S I R,                             Forfar, May 16th,  1728.

AC C O R D I N G to your Desire, I have
sent you an Account of the lamen-
table Catastrophe,  which  happen'd
on Thursday the 9th of May instant,   which
has filled all the Kingdom with an universal
Regret ; and this Part of it with the utmost
Grief and Confusion imaginable,  which is
to be seen in the Faces young and old,
all over the Country ; the  Fact is as follow,

"  On Thursday being the 9th Instant, several of the neigh-
"  bouring Gentlemen were invited to this Place to   a Burial,
"  and among the rest the Earl of Strathmore,   Carnegie  of
"  Finhaven, and Mr. Lyon of Brigton ; after the Burial was o-
"  ver, a great many of the Gentlemen ;   among whom were
"  these three before mentioned, went to a Tavern,   where
"  after they had been there some Time, Finhaven and Erig-
"  ton fell a quarrelling, as some say, concerning the   Lady
"  Kinfawns, whose Brother Finhaven is;   and others say   it
" was about the Marriage of a Daughter of Finhaven's to a
" young Gentleman in this Country ; but however that be,
" Finhaven went to take his Horse, and had one foot in the
"  Stirup, as his Servants say, when Brigton attack'd him,and
"  threw him in a Mire, where he had Certainly perish'd, had
"  not his Servants come to his Rescue,    together with the
" deceast Earl ;    Finhaven was no sooner recover'd and his
"  Servants endeavouring to make clean his Cloaths,     but he
"  drew his Sword ;  and the Earl stepping  in to prevent any
"  Mischief that might happen, received from Finhaven a mor-
"  tal Wound, abou  an lnch below his Navel, which woun-
"  ded his Puddings in three Parts, and went  quite throrow
''  his Body.     His Lordship,     after he received the Wound,
"  spoke little till Saturday's Night he called for his Lady, en-
"  deavouring to comfort her,    and grasping her Hand,     he
"  died about 12 a Clock that Night.    This is the unfortu-
" nate End of this  universally beloved Nobleman,    whose
" rare Qualities render'd him an Ornament to his Country,
" a  Pattern   of  Youth,     and the Admiration of all that
" knew him.
