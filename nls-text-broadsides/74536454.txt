An Excellent New Song lately composed
INTITULED.
The New way of Pittcathly Well
Or, The Gentlemans Love to his Mistress

To the Tune of Pollwarth on the Green,

One Morning as I walk't
In the gay Time of the Year
When Sporting Nymphe do Frisk about
To drink the Water clear,
Among'st the rest I spyed a Nymph,
Whose Beauty did excell,
The Croud  of Nymphs that now resort   
The fam'd Pittcathly Well.

With Dying Looks I veiw'd her
And could not shun, but say,
Pray make  me your Phisician,
She blushing  said me Nay.
I ask't at her, to take a Walk,
She fear'd we would be seen,
Well take a walk in woods or Groves
in our Pittcathly Green.

Our scriving much at last,
Kind Nature took my Part,
We Walk't by Neptun's pleasant Streams
Till Jeanny won my Heart,
Were I Sole Monarch of the Glob,
I'd give it all to thee           
For all the Maids about the Well,
My Jeanny bears the Gree.

When I come home at Noon,
Refresh with Country Air,
Each courts his Mistress up and down
And I my Jannie fair.
We danc'd right kind upon the Green,
And All sing  merrily.
Pittcathly Well invits you All,
Come here good Company.

When I go Home at Night,
With Love and care opprest,
My Jeanies Image still present,
And Robes me of my Rest,
I Dream of her my Souls Delight,
Whose Air and graceful mean.
Makes her envy'd by all the Nymphs     
In our Pittcatthly  Green,

O were I but so blest
as freely call the mine,
I'de treat thee in my Fathers House
With Country Cheer that's fine
And if there be no Downy Beds,
I'le chose a place unseen,
Where young Swans do often Shape,
There Nymphs a gown of Green.
