TUNEâ€”Original.

When I was young and youth did bloom,
Where fancy led me, I did roam ;
From town to town the country round,
Through every sylvan shady grove.
Until I came from Scotland by name,
Where beauty shines on every side,
There's no town there we can compare
With Glasgow fair, on the banks of Clyde.

As I went out in the evening clear,
By the banks of Clyde I chanc'd to gang,
There I met a weel far'd lass,
Her beauty put me in a trance.
Her cherry cheeks and ruby lips,
Her hair in ringlets down did glide,
And fain would I have kissed her lips
As she walk'd on the banks of Clyde.

I spier'd at her, and said, fair maid
How far this road do you mean to gang ?
A mile or two, kind sir. she said,
Towards a town called Long Govan.
Will you take company my pretty maid,
With one who's willing to make a bride ?
Se arm in arm without fear of harm,
They walk'd along the banks of Clyde.

I'm afraid you are from Ireland,
And from Belfast just come o'er ;
A sea-port town of great renown,
Towards the north or eastern shore ;
That you have left a beaut bright,
Who is well known to be your bride,
Therefore, says she, " 'tis dangerous for me
To walk with you on the banks of Clyde."

I said no more but I went with her,
The waters they were running clear,
The small birds gone into their nests,
The moon in glances did appear;
I put my arm around her waist,
Her fears now began to subside,
And ofttimes I kiss'd her ruby lips
As she lay upon the banks of Clyde.

But what we did, or what we said,
There's no one breathing here shall know ;
Ofttimes I kiss'd her ruby lips,
While her colours swift did come and go.
Sir, since you've got your will, she says,
I pray make me your lawful bride;
I promised to meet her there again,
But I forgot, and cross'd the Clyde.
