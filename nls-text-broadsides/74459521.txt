NEW SONGS OUT EVERY WEEK,
I once did know a farmer, a good old jolly soul,
Who used to work upon the farm aroud his contry home.
He had an only daughter and to win her I did try.
And when I asked him for her hand these words he did ro

CHORUS.

"Treat my daughter kindly, and say you'll do no harm,
And when I die I'll leave to you my little house and farm
My horse, my plough, my sheep, my cow, my hogs and

l'ttle barn,

And all those little chickens in the garden.
I own I love this darling girl and dearly she loves me
I used to go aroud her home her smiling face to see,
To watch her milk her father's cows and admire her

          every cham,

And meny a drink of milk I got before I left the barn.
SPOKEN---Yes, and the old man would join hands

together,putting one of his own on each of our hands, he

would say, "God bless you little children; and young man
remember I'll brake your back if you don't a ways.
Treat my daughter, "etc

Now the old man has consented and marred we will be
Wi'll own a little farm ourselves and live in harmony ;
I'll use her well, his only chil l, and I'll treat her kindly

And I'll strive to keep the promise that the old man

asked of me.

SPOKENâ€”And, oh. Lord! how his eyes used to twinkle
and how it used  to tickle, me every time I'd hare him say.
Treat my daughter," etc
