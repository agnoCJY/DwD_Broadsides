The Widdows Rant, Or a Wedding-Song;
upon Widdow Jackson in Borthuicks-Closs.



Composed by one of her own sexes.

All ye Wifes in this Town
Thats moved for your Men,

And ye that puts on Mourning deep
When they are dead for them ;

And cryeth O my dear
Since thou art from me gone,
To no Man else I'll Wedded be
But live single alone.             

Detain your selves from sobs,
And harken to my call,
I'Ie tell you of a Chast Widow
The Honour of you all;

It doth not much exceed
A Moneth or five weeks space,
Since she put on her mourning Weed
And fiegned her face ;

And so her Neighbour said,
when she was Mourning sore, 
Ye are a Widdow now indeed
And woe is us therefore.

Said she hold ye your peace 
And be not troubled Sore
For though my man be freely dead ;
I am even as before;

For when he was alive
Although he lay me near,
Nevertheless a Widdow I
Have been more then ten year;

But Notwith standing she
For him hath tane such care,
That sleep and rest is freely gone
From her both late and air.

For which she did complain
Unto the Pastor then,
Because that for her Husbands death
She was grieved with pain.

But yet her Neighbours dreads
That she her self did fain,
And say s it was but Tam auld's Fleas
That made her seek the Men.

It's likewise said by some,
That her Man's gan again,
And others say that by his Grips
They are sting to the Bayne.

But whither its because
That she hath him forgot,
That he is going through the Closs,
This truly I know not.

Or if it be because,
That she hath her Bed Cloathed,
With covrings, and with other things,
Which he hath wholly loathed.

Or if it be indead,
Because that she doth spend,
The Mony on Beads, Kalls, and Rings,
By which his Son should send.

Or if in fine it be,
That Ale raising their Brain,
Makes them see three, where there,s but two
Determine if ye can.

Nevertheless she hath
A remedie procur'd,
By which she may be freed from Fleas;
And of their sting procur'd.

By finding out a Man,
That of such things had Skill,
As killing Fleas, and healing stings,
Which tempted her most ill.

But as some ones doth Judge
He plasters did apply, 
Before that he was Graduat,
Fearing that she should dye.

But least that ye should doubt
Of whom I have thus Rim'd
I'le tell you Name, and Surname both,
That I may ease your mind.

She is a Lustie Wife,
and thinks her self no dross,
Her Name's call'd Nansie Crukshanks,
She lives in Borthuicks-Closs.
FINIS.
