PRICE ONE PENNY,

The sea was bright, and the bark rode wall,
The breeze bore the tone of the vasper bell,
'Twas a gallant bark. with a crew as brave,
As ever launch'd on the heaving wave:
She shone in the light of declining day,
Each sail was set, and each heart was gay.

We neared the land wherein beauty smiles,
The sunny  shores of the Grecian isles.
We thought of home, and that welcome dear,
That soon would greet each wanderer's ear;
And in fancy joined the social throng
The festive dance, and the joyous song

A white cloud flies through the azure sky
What means that wild despairing cry!
Farewell the vision d scenes of home,
The cry is' Help!, where no help can come,
For the white squall rides on the surging wave,
And the bark is gulph'd in an ocean grave.
