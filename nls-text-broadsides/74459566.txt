THE              

Four-Leaved Shamrock.

PRICE ONE PENNY

This is supposed to be one of Shields' pro-
ductions, and the Poet in offering it to the
public has every confidence that it will be a
tangible treat ; the Poet is certain that it is
one of the finest effusions extant, and from
his long experience, he would invite all lovers
of song and music to come and judge for
themselves by procuring copies, which can
only be had in the Poet's Box, 6 St. Andrew's
Lane, Gallowgate, Glasgow.

Airâ€” Original.

I'll seek a four-leaved shamrock;
In all the fairy dells,
And if I find the charmed leaf
Oh, how I'll weave my spells!
I would not waste my magic might,
On diamond, pearl, or gold;
For treasure tires the weary sense,
Such triumph is but cold ;
But I will play the enchanter's part,
In casting bliss around;
Oh, not a tear nor aching heart,
Should in the world be found.

To worth, I would give honour,
I'd dry the mourner's tears,
And to the pallid lip recall
The smile of happier years ;
And hearts that had been long estranged,
And friends that had grown cold,
Should meet again like parted streams,
And mingle as of old.
		Oh, thus I'd play, &c,

The heart that had been, mourning,
O'er vanished dreams of love,
Should see them all returning
Like Noah's faithful dove ;
And hope should launch her blessed bark.
On sorrow's darkening sea,
And misery's children have an ark,
And saved from sinking be.
		Oh, thus I'd play, &c.
