THE HANSEE POEM

           OF THE

Deliverers of the Mid-Lothian Adbertiser

BY ONE OF THEMSELVES.

Respectit Freen's, baith great an' sma',
In hamely rhyme we greet ye a',
Sincerely hopin' Sixty-twa,
Whan dead an' gane,
May leave within ilk hoose an' ha'
Nae grief or pain.

May Dame Misfortune's dauds an' clours
Be never felt by you nor yours !
May Heaven keep ye an' the flow'rs,
Whilk tenderly
Ye rear in your domestic bow'rs,
Frae sorrow free!

Wi' you whilk dae us patronise,
An' in our Paper advertise,
We humbly seek tae sympathise,
Baith ane an' a',—
We hope tae see your fortunes rise,
An' markets fa'.

Whan lookin' back upon the year
Fast deein' oot, we drap a tear
Ower the misfortunes, dark an' drear,
Whilk has befa'n
Our freen's abroad an' neighbours near
On ilka haun'.

But in the hope that Sixty-three
May bring us happiness an' glee,
We'll welcom't in wi' three times three
Whan ilka nock,
Baith high an' low, baith big an' wee,
Strikes twelve o'clock.

Noo, kindly hopin' that you may
Enjoy yoursels on New-Year's Day,
We trust that whan on Hogmanay
We ring your bell,
Tour haun' may tae your pocket stray,—
Sae noo, farewell!
