CUDDY  PEGGY.
COPIES CAN BE HAD  AT 190 AND 192 OVERGATE, DUNDEE.

In the high town of Gala lived auld Peggy Tinlin,

Wha was blessed wi' content, though at times took to grumblin'; 

Her calling in life was provisions to hawk,

And David, her cud, bore them a' on his back !

Each morning they marched to their daily employ,

Nae task did they think it, but rather a joy ;
And David jogged on wi' his weel-laden creels,
While Peggy half-bent hirpled on at his heels.

Frae morning to micht thus wandered alane, 

But aye at the dusk o' the gloamin' cam' hame;

And when Peggy had selt aff the guids o' her pack,

Then she mounted astride and rode hame on his back.

For mony a lang year thus they toiled on thegither,

And the langer they toiled they grew fonder o' ither,

For David shr seldom had reason to flog,

Thongh gently she touched him at times wi' the brogue,
But it happened a'e day that poor David took ill,
Which the heart o' auld Peggy wi' sadness did fill,
And a sorrowfu' tear filled the auld body's e'.
As she thocht tae hersel' puir David wad dee;

And seeing him placed in this helpless condition,

She thocht it her duty to get a physician,

So away for that purpose she hurriedly set,

When just on the way she the minister met.

" Well. Margaret! " he said, " I hope you are well."

" I thank you," said Peggy, " I'm gaily mysel' ;  

But I'm sorry to say oor David's no' weel, 

 An I'm just gaun away to get medical skill."

"Indeed, to hear that I'm exceedingly sorry,   

But, if spared, I'll come down and see him to-morrow,"

So wi' that Peggy bowed and speedily withdrew,

Syne awa' like the wind on her errand she flew,

The doctor came prompt at auld Peggy's request.
Thinkin' a' the road up what he might suggest 
So his patient wi' skill he minutely surveyed.
And then shook his head and reluctantly said ! -
" His case it is bad—nay, hopeless I doubt-
But I'll try what I can to bring him about."
So he blistered and bled him and gave him a dose. 

O' the best o' strong physic, as one might suppose,

And these means they were blest to bring David relief,

And to ease at the same time the auld body's grief,

For as David grew  weel her spirits grew licht,

And her e'e, lichtly dimmed, shone wonderfu' bricht,

The minister, who to his word ever true,

Come clown the next day as he promised to do,

On purpose, no doubt, as a matter of course,

To see whether David was better or worse.

" Well, Margaret," he said, " how is David to-day? "
" Deed, sir, he's some better, I'm happy to say ; 

The doctor's been here, and used every means, 

And to outward appearance some better he seems."
" I'm glad to hear that; I hope he'll recover,
And that both may be spared a while to each other."
" Deed, sir, I'm glad and thankfu' atweel.
For little I thocht to have seen him sae weel ; 

But come in sir, and rest you a bit,"

" Oh ! thanks."'said he, " I scarcely must sit,
But, if it's convenient, with David I'll pray."

"Lord bless me, sir, what on earth do you say ?"

" I'll pray with your husband that's now in distress."

" The deil's in the man—would you pray for an ass ?"                   

" Oh, fie ! Margaret, he ! why don't you think shame

To call your poor husband by such a vile name ? "

" My husband !— I daursay the minister's mad— 

It's mony a year sin' my husband was dead,"

" Oh, Margaret, you don't mean to say it is true?"
" It's as true as this minute I'm speaking to you,"

"Then is David your son or relation in blood?"

" Guid gracious'! the man? isn't David the cud?"
'A cud!" cried the parson; "aye, a cuddy! " cried she;

"Sic a farce to compare a dumb creatur' to me."

" Oh, Margaret! I find I've been quite mistaken,
I, David your cud for you husband have taken,

So pardon what I've in my ignorance said

And the awkward mistake into which I've been led."
So the priest no longer protracted his stay,

But wi' reverence bowed, and syne went away,

And laughed a' the road hame till nearly distracted,
To think sic a part in the drama he acted.
