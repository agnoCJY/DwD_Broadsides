'Tis Hard to Give

THE HAND

WHERE THE

HEART CAN NEVER BE,

NEW SONGS OUT EVERY WEEK.

This Popular Song can always be had at the Poets' Booc.

Tho' I mingle in the throng
Of the happy and the gay,
From the mirth of dance and song
I would fain be far away ;
For I love to use no wile,
And can but deem it sin,
That the brow should wear a smile
When the soul is sad within.
Tho' a parent's stern command
Claims obedience from me,
O, 'tis hard to give the hand
Where the heart can never be.

I have sighed and suffer'd long,
Yet have never told my grief
In the hope that for my wrong,
Time itself would find relief,
I will own no rebel thought,
But I will not wear the chain,
That for me must still be fraught,
With but misery and pain.
In all else I will be bland,
But in this I must be free,
And I will not give the hand
Where the heart can never be.
