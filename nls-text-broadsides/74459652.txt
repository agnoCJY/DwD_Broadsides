An Excellent new Song lately composed
Entituled. the Pearel of the lrish Nation.

To its own Proper New Tune.

HArd was my Lot for to be shot,
By Cupits Cunning Arrows,
Both Night and Day I fall away,

Through persit grief and Sorrow,
To the Hills and Deals left Reveal,

And breaths forth my Lamentation,
Which I endure for that Virgin pure,

The Pearel of the Irish Nation,
Her Beauty so bright hath dazled my Sight,

and alas my poor Heart it is wounded,
No way can I find for to ease my Mind

By Cupit I am fore wounded,
Great is my Pain that I sustain,

and sad is my grief and Vexcation,
And all for the sake of a Beautiful Dame,

The Pearel of the Irish Nation,
Though many there be that dayly I see;

of Beautiful Charming Creatures,
With   Rid Rosie Cheeks and Ruby Lips,

and like wife Comlie Features,
But yet there is None Abroad or at Home.

in Country, Town, or Plantation,
That can compare with that Virgin Fair,

The Pearel of the Irish Nation.
No way Can I find to ease my Mind,

but spends my Time in weeping,
I Sigh and Groan, I Sob and I Moan,

whilst others lay by me a Sleeping,
To some Lonsome place I will go for a Space

and there I'le make my habitation,
Since I cannot gain that Berutiful Dame,

The Pearel of the Irish Nation,
I know there's some that think that I Murn,

and make my whole moan for the Lillle
Perhaps it is so but the Case of my woe,

is for the Ross that grows in the Vellie,
She's rare to be seen like Venas the Queen

for Modestie, Vertue and Patience,
My heart is in linckt with that Beautiful pink

The Pearel of the Irish Nation,
Alas there's none can ease my moan,

but only that Charming Creature,
Her chceks like the ross which sweetlie grows

hard by the Banks of the Ceder.
Her Name to declar this Time I'll forebear

though my Heart be filled with Vexcation.
Yet you may suppose she's called the Ross,

The Pearel of the lrish Nation,
These Lines I intend to have Pened,

and sent to my dearest Jewel,
To let her know part of, my woes

and if she chance to prove Cruel;

Like a Pilgrim I'll go thro' Frost and Snow

I'll foresake my former Station,
Since I cannot gain that Beautiful Dame;

The Pearel of the Irish Nation.              

I'd Transport Spain  from thence to Lorain.

I'll often times Cross the wide Occan,
Since Sorrow and  Pain throw disdain,

hath happen'd to be my Fortune,
If Hungar and Cold should on me take hold,

or cause me to Dye in the Station,
The Woods shall not ring nor hear me to Sing,
of the Pearel of  the Irish Nation.

Though I am sad yet if I had,

But part of the Gifts of Ovid,
With a willing Mind to what I am inelin'd,

And freely I have disclosed,
My Name I'll rehearse and put it in Verse

since I have made a Declaration,
For I Vow and I Swear my Heart is insnar'd

By the Pearel of the Irish Nation
P is a part and A is an Art,

and Tis a Teacher of Strangers,
R, I, C, is the Number of Three.

and K is the Keeper of Chambers,
The K shall be King, when E cannot Ring,

and L most ly by in his Station
The Y shall be young when it is now Sung

she's the Pearel of the Irish Nation,
Virgins most kind when you Read these Lines

and have the   same   perused,
If I have said ought out of the Way,

Pray you let me be Excused,
An Answer pray send to what I have Pend,

since I have made a Declaration,
For I Vow and I Swear my heart is insnar'd

by the Pearel of the Irish  Nation.

The Second Part.
O then replyed this Beautiful Bride,

Her answer it was with Discreation,
My Parents they say will turn me away,

if I Join  with your Prosession,
Out of this Land as I understand,

they'l turn me where I will see no Man
If I Attemp without Consent,

to marry a  Man that's a Reman.
My Dear said he if you will agree,

this day with me to   Marry,
There's Gold and Land at your Command

Therefore let us not  tarrie,
For let your Friends say what they can

I am oblidged to no Man,
There's  Gold and Land at your Command

although I am a Roman.
Alas why do you slight me so;

is it for my  Religion,
You are ungreatful if you do,

hold me in such Dirision.
For if all the Grecion Gold were mine,

on you I would bestow it,
Therefore your Heart to me resign,          

before your   Parents knows of it;         
O then she said as I'm a  Maid,

This Day I'll freely Marrie,
Therefore let us not be afraid,

Let Us no longer Tarrie,
For let my friends say what they can,

I'll never be ruled by no man,
My Heart and Hand's at thy command

altho' thou be a Roman.                        

This loving couple married were,
in Plenty Peace and Pleasure.
Near Castelblany as we hear,
enjoying store of Treasure,
This Young Man free from care and Strief

enjoys his charming Jewel,
she proves a Vertues Loving Wife,

although    her Friends was Creuel.
