A gude New-year to ane and a',
And mony may ye see,
And during a' the years to come,
Oh, happy may ye be.
And may ye ne'er ha'e cause to mourn,
To sigh or shed a tearâ€”
To ane and a', baith great and sma',
A hearty guid Naw-year.
Chorus -A gude New-year to ane and a',
And mony may ye see,
And during a' the years to come,
Oh, happy may ye be.

Oh, Time flies-he winna wait.
My friend, for you or me;
He works his wonders day by day,
And onward still doth flee.
Oh, wha can tell when ilka ane
I see sae happy here,
Will meet Again, and merry be,
Anither guid New-year.
-Chorus.

We twa ha'o baith been happy lang,
We ran about the braes-
In yon wee cot, beneath the tree,
We spent our early days.
We ran about the burnie's side,
The spot will aye be dear.
And those that used to meet us there,
We'll think on mony a year.
-Chorus.

Now lot us hope our years may be
As guid as they ha'o been,
And trust we ne'er again may see
The sorrow we hae seen.
And let me wish that one and a',
Our friends, baith far and near,
May aye enjoy, in times to come,
A hearty guid New-year.
-Chorus.
