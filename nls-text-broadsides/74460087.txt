Brigadier M'Intosh's Farewel to the Highlands.

To an excellent new Tune.

M'INTOSH is a Soldier brave,
and of his Friends he took his Leave,
Unto Northumberland he drew,
and march'd along with a jovial Crew.
with a fa la la ra da ra da.

My Lord Dernwentwater he did say,
five hundred Guineas he would lay,

To fight the Milltia if they would stay,
but they all prov'd Cowards and ran away,
with a fa la, &c.

The Earl of Mar did vow and swear,
if that proud Preston he came near,
Before the Right should starve, and the Wrong
(should stand,

He would drive them into some foreign Land,
with a fa la, &c.

My Lord Dernwentwater he did say,
when he mounted on his dapple Gray,

I wish I were at home with Speed,
for I fear  we are all betray'd indeed.

with a fa la, &c.

No, no, says Foster never fear,
the Brunswick Army is not near,

But if that they come, our Valour  we'll show,
and give them a fatal Overthrow.

with a fa la, &c.

My Lord Dernwentwater when he found,
that Foster had drawn his left Wing round,

Said, I wish, that I were with my dear Wife,
for I fear that I will lose my Life.

with a fa , la, &c.

M'intosh he shook his Head,
to see his Soldiers all ly dead,

It was not for the Loss of those,
but I fear we're taken by our Foes.

      With a fa la, &c.

M'Intosh is a valiant Soldier,
he carried a Musket on his Shoulder,
Cock your Pistols draw your Rappet,
damn you Foster, for you are a Trattor.
with a fa la, &c.

My Lord Derwentwater to Foster did say,
thou has prov'd our Ruin this very Day,

Thou promised to stand our Friend,
but thou hast prov'd a Rogue in the End
With a fa la, &C.

My Lord Derwentwater to Litchfield did ride

with Coach and Attendants by his Side,

He swore if he dy'd on the Point of a Sword,

he'd drink a good Health to the Man that

 he loved:

with a fa la, &c.

Thou Foster has brought us from our own
Home,

leaving our Estates for others to come. 

Thou treacherous Dog thou hast us betray'd,

we are all ruin'd Lord Dernwentwater said,

with a fa la, &c.

My Lord Derwentwater he is condemn'd,

and neat unto his Latter-end,
His poor Lady she did cry,

My dear Derwentwater thou must die.

with a fa la, &c.

, My Lord Dernwentwater he is dead,
    and from his Body they took his Head,
But M'Intosh and others are fled,
to fit his Hat on another Man's Head.

With a fa la la da ra &c.

FINIS.
