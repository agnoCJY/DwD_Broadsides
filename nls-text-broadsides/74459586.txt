A Favourite Song, called,

The Harp of Caledonia.

WHEN Scotia tun'd her rustic lyre,
And bad her sons to fame aspire,
To touch wi' nature's glowan fire,
	The harp of Caledonia.

Then many a plaided minstrel fam'd,
Mong Scotia's glens the giftie claim'd,
But owre them a', her Burns she- nam'd,
	The Bard of Caledonia.

On banks and braes o' bonnie Doon,
She found the Bardie wand'ring roun',
When first he try'd his reed to tune,
	And sing of Caledonia,

This harp be thine she smiling said,
And bound the holly roun' his head,
Hence ever let ray poet's mead.
	Be love and Caledonia;.

He sung the cottar's humble tale,
Which brightens life's obscurest vale,
He sung his country's saddest wail,
	And wept for Caledonia.

His harp brought heroes frae the dead,
Those " Scots wha had wi' Wallace bled,
" Wham Bruce to glory aft had led,"
	The pride of Caledonia.

O ! sweetly flow'd his melting strain,
In varied scenes of bliss and pain,
Whilst love re-echoed back again,
	The son of Caledonia.

And fondly o'er his harp he hang,
When Scotland's liberty he sang,
In boldest strains the chorus rang,
	Be free my Caledonia.

But now his mirth and glee are o'er,
And Scotia hears her Bard no more,
Yet still his song f'rae shore to shore,
	Lives blight in Caledonia,

And let " departed worth" engage,
The brightest lines of mem'ry's page,
And fame shall name frae age to age.
	The Bard of Caledonia.

Immortal now in Scottish song,
'Mid classic Bards he heads the throng,
Whilst fame the tidings bears along.
	And cheers up Caledonia.

Then fill the quaigh wi' barley brec,
Whilst Scotlan's sons ca" Scotlan" free, 
We'll aye unite and pledge the three,
	Love, Burns, and Caledonia.
