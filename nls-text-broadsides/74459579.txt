     THE

GRAVE O'


RABBIE      BURNS

Original and Correct   Version,  written
and composed by Alex. Melville







There wis a laud wis born in Kyle,

In winter cauld an' drear,
An' tho' that he is faur awa',

His memory's ever dear.
The dew-draps glisten on his grave,

An' linger there for lang;
For love is he among the mools,

Auld Scotland's son o' sang.

            CHORUS



Scotland's Bard that's noo awa;

Rabbie Burns—Immortal Burns;
Dear wis he tae yin an' a',

Tae him oor memory turns. 

When summer nichts were lang an' fair,

He wander'd by the banks o'Ayr ;

The hairt o' every Scotchman's in'
The Grave o' Rabbie Burns.



'Mang Mither Nature's solitnde

     He roved for mony a mile; 

An' sang a aboot the woods an' braes  

O' bonnie Ballochmyle.
Tae Hielan Mary an' his Jean

     Oor fancy over turns;

But aye we'll think upon the spot
Whaur lies puir Rabbie Burns.



The flowers begin tae bloom in spring,

In winter drear they fade ;
The suntioht glints ower hill an' glon,

An' lichtens up the glade.
The birds may warble on the trces

   Till even-tide does fa'— 

But silent is the voice o'him 

That noo is faur awa'-
