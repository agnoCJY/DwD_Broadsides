PRETTY

LITTLE NELL

THE

FARMERS

Daughter.

WHEN strolling on one summer's day down
	a country lane,
Just for a change of air, my boys, from town that
	day I came,
On  looking round I there beheld a blue eyed
	country lass,
At a well drawing water,  and she smiled  as I
	went past.

Chorus.

Pretty little Nell, the farmer's daughter
I met her at the well drawing water,    
And as I passed her by, I caught the  roguish eye,
Of pretty little Nell, the farmer's daughter

I raised my hat. she blushuig said my manners
	were polite,
I replied a country life must be one scene of
	delight!
She said she was quite  happy in her country
	life so gay,
I  begged that she would meet me, at the well
	again next day.

At the time appointed I was there, the birds sang
	out their lay,
Sweet Nelly met me at the well, she had just
	done making hay;
I put my arms around her waist, and pressed her
	to my side,
Then ask'd this little Village Queen, if she'd be
	my bride.

So   now   we're joined   together, by   marriage
	closest tie.
There is no care or strife between my darling
	wife and I,
And in onr little country home, with our children
	Rose and Nell,
Oft reminds me of the happy day, and the meet-
	of the well.

DOWN

AMONG

THE

COAL.

JEMIMA lived  in service  once, at a house
	in St. Enoch Square,
She ne'er  got out, so I used to go and   cour
	her there,
Her mistersses were two old maids, such very
	particular souls.
That Jemima, often had to hide me, down among
	the coals.

Chorus:

Down among the coals, down among the coals,
All alone and in the dark, I say boys, it is a lark
Down among the coals, down among the cools,
Waiting to make love, to my Jemima.

When in the cellar, cobwebs used to decorate
	my clothes,
The coal dust got into  my eyes, and would
	get up my nose;
And when it rained, the water came trickling
	through a crack,
And  I always fancied,  spiders were  crawling
	up my back.

One night they sent Jemima out, she'd forgotten
	her dear Joe,
Was down among the Walls-ends, and a prisoner
	down below;
I began to freeze, was  obliged to sneeze, and
	I felt inclined to shout,
So I hollo'd through the key-hole, "Here Jemima
	let me out.

At lenght the door was open'd-'twas dark, oh
	best of  bliss,
I flopped my arms around her neck, and gave
	her such a kiss;
A  scream, and  then  a  shovel, gave me one
	upon the head,
I kiss'd her ancient mistress, I needn't say I fled

Love laughs at Locksmiths, so they say, that
	was the case with us,
Of course Jemima got the sack, it caused a dread-
	ful fuss;
But I married her soon after that, and we're as
	happy as a king,
And often round our cosy fire, this is what
	we sing.
