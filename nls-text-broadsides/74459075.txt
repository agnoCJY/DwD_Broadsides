Bird of the wilderness,
Blithesome and cumberless,
Sweet is thy matin o'er moorland and lea !
Emblem of happiness,
Blest is thy dwelling-place,
Oh, to abide in the desert with thee.
Wild is thy lay and loud,
Far in the downy cloud,
Love gives  it energy, love gave  it birth ;
Oh, where on thy dewy wing,
Where art thou journeying ?
Thy lay's in heav'n, thy love is on earth.

Bird of the wilderness,
Blithesome and cumberless,
Sweet be thy matin o'er moorland and lea !
Emblem of happiness,
Blest is thy dwelling-place,
Oh, to abide in the desert with thee.

O'er fell and fountain sheen,
O'er moor and mountain green,
O'er the red streamer that heralds the day ;
Over the cloudlet dim,
Over the rainbow's rim,
Musical  cherub,  soar,  singing  away  !
Then when the gloaming comes,
Low in the heather blooms,
Sweet will thy welcome and bed of love be ;
Oh, emblem of happiness,
Blest is thy dwelling-place,
Oh, to abide in the desert with thee.
Bird of the wilderness,
Blithesome and cumberless,
Oh, to abide in the desert with thee.
