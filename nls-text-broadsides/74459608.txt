THE LASS O' GOWRIE.

'Twas on a summer's afternoon,
A wee before the sun  gaed down,
My lassie, wi' a braw new gown,
	Came o'er the hill to Gowrie.
The rose-bud tinged wi' morning showers
Bloom'd fresh with'n the sunny bowers,
But Kitty was the fainst flower                        
	That ever bloom'd in Gowrie.

I praised her beauty loud and  lang,
Then round her waist my arms I flang,
And said, " My lassie , will ye gang
	To view the Carse o' Gowrie 
I'll take ye to my father's ha',
In yon green field beside the shaw,
And make you lady o' them a',
	The brawest wife in Gowrie."

Sift kisses on her lips I laid—
The blush upon her cheek soon spread :—
She whisper'd modestly, and said,
	" I'll gang wi' yon to Gowrie."
The auld folk  form soon gi d their consent,
And to Mess John we quickly went,
wha tied us to our heart's content,
	And now she's lady Gowrie.
