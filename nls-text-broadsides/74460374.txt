cabbage cloth and buttons up behind his belly; his gloves were of cast-

and hard of hearing with the other; is slightly pock-marked at the
back of the head, stoops upright when he walks crooked, has a slight
impediment in his look, wears a Grecian bend on lower top lip, whiskers
cut off short inside; was carrying an empty carpet box in each hand
and a wooden bag in the other, containing screw steamers, railway
tunnels, and blacking; was born after his younger brother, his mother
being absent on the occasion.

up the Grass Mountains near the Mouth of Vesuvius
with the Falls of Niagara under his arm.

where he is will be persecuted as the law directs.
