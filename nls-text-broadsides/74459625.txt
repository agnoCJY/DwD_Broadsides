THE MASHERS

OF RAMSEY'S PEND

This Popular Song can always be had at the
Poet's Box, 224 Overgate, Dundee

We'll sing you a song, and it wont be long,
If you listen to what we say
It's about two girls you know very well
And they live straight over the way.
There cheeks are as red as a piece of white
chalk,
And they wear a Grecian bend ;
There's no mistake about it,
They're the mashers of Ramsey's Pend

CHORUS.

For their nose is a dark blue red,
And there hair is a sky blue green;
They're the prettiest piece of potted head
That ever we have seen.
There face is all covered with muck,
And they wear a Grecian bend;
There's 110 mistake about it,
They're the mashers of Ramsey's Pend.

One night to a ball we took those young
girls,
They were waltzing all over the place.
The conductor came over and said "Clear
the way,"
I'll knock in your potted head face.
They said "Dont you try it, we'll go for
the slops,"
They began to shout and roar.
We gave them a clash in the kissie kiss
kiss
And there false teeth fell out on the floor.

CHORUSâ€”For their nose etc,
