A C C O U N T 

Of the Life and Actions of James Inglis
alias Clipstir, who is to be execute upon
Wednesday the first of May, for the
Crimes of Horse and Sheepstealing,

Being a Compound of his known Villanies, for the space of Fourty Years by past.

NO more this aged Sinner cheats the Tree,
Or swings  a Helter round him wi' a Swie,
Slips sliely bain throw' Stable Barn and Byre,
To seek a Horse Beast but a Bodle Hire,
And rides the Aver till he reach the Tae,
Or  in his Pocket hears the Pawny nie , 
His Duds in Dackers now dance to and thrae,
And no ae Foals Price has he to buy mae.
Hard Fate forsooth, ware he but anes let out,
And fairly mounted on a mureland Coot,
He'd cag to Cairlisle, sid it cost his Craig,
And seek white Siller for his stoln Neag ;
Sine sell him there, and soon steal back his ain,
Or an as good's the last the Fock took fae'm ;
Come branken as but Bargain, never fash
His Thumb, 'bout Threatnings or his theiv-
	ing Pash
Sadel'd and briddel'd wi' a bra Buss belt,
Bren new Gramashes and a Coat o' Kelt,
A spliet new Bannet and a borrowed Wig,
That ne'er look'd bonsie on the Buyer's Head.
 Showed James but jearen. as he troted on,
A out as onest as his Father's Son :
Or's Billy Sandy, who at Sea harras'd,
The Captain's Stock Purse, and strang on the
	Mast.    
Twae sweeter Birds ne'er chirl'd in an Age,
Or sed more frequent in an Iron Cage;
From which, by no Means they could be re-
	stran'd,
Til goal the Gallows gave them to be wean'd.
'Tis Fact at first, they feigned faithsae Gaets,
Which for a wi' While haid their thieving Eats'
Indwellers both in Dirleton due East,
Each Wife and  Children, had yet neither
	ceas'd.
To rob their Neighbours of their Horse and
	Sheep,
And steal their Victual while their vail'd wi'
	Sleep.               .         
Corn, Kiln, ana Barn, kindled to a Flame,

Throw curst Contention, is consum'd by them.
Who knowing Justice, would them there o're-
	take,
Left their Possessions for their Persons sake.
Sandy serv'd Pirat, and at Lisbon wore,
A hempen Cravet, as I said before 
But Jams ne're trusts the Haman, e're he tries,
Fou aft how kindly he the Cure applies,
A cross his Carcass, e're he cast the Knot,
And draw a running Roller round his Throat.
A wary way of working now we see,
There's nane se cordial as Dalglish and he;
No not his Wife Tib Tenant nor the Whore
He stoll from Haddington, whan he was poor,
Who for twice Twelve Years by past, brought
	him forth,
Fouth of Provisiors o' their Father's worth.
And Wiles to weal a willart  Beast aside,
That he with Safety might  get oh and, ride
For every Gelden that gaed wrang or  strayed
James had the Fortoun to be double paid.   
First by the Buyer, for a double Barb,
Next by the Hangy, for a hanging Carb;
Who leath to leave him, whan he'd let him ga
Wad ne'er twin wi' him e're he got his pae.
And yet no sooner he begins to act,
Than in a Moment Marshal's at his Back.
Nought wanting but the Word to cast him o'f
And make him croka, e're the Clock stric -
	Four.
Which shall be granted, against May the Fir ,
When on a Scassel James is poorly hors'd.
And gaen about, like an of Hangie's Client,
By his twae Wives, and their twae Set     
	Wieans.
Syne train'd through Time, to tell his Tri[  ]
	him sell,
May God hae Mercy on his greedy Saul.
