The Light of other days

PRICE ONE PENNY.
Copies of this highly popular song can only be had in the Poet's Box, 6 St Andrew's Lane, Glasgow

Air-Original.

The light of other days is faded,
And their glories past;
For grief with heavy wing hath shaded,
The hopes too bright to last,
The world with morning's mantle, clouded,
Shines forth with purer rays;
But the heart ne'er feels, in sorrow shrouded,
The light of other days.

The leaf which autumn tempests wither,
The birds which then take wing,
When winter's winds are past, come hither
To welcome back the spring.
The very ivy on the ruin,
In gloom full life displays;
But the heart alone sees no renewing
The light of other-days.
