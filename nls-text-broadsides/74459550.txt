A wee bit raggit laddie gangs wan'ren thro' the street,
Wadin' 'mang the snaw wi' his wee hackit feet,
He's shiv'rin' i' the cauld blast, greetin' wi' the pain ;
Wha's the puir wee callan ? he's a drunkard's raggit wean.
He stan's at ilka door, and he keeks wi' wistfu' e'e,
To see the crood aroun' the fire, a' laughin' loud wi' glee ;
But he daurna venture ben, tho' his heart be e'er sae fain,
For he manna play wi' ither bairns—the drunkard's raggit
wean.

Oh, see the wee bit bairnie, his heart is unco fou,
The sleet is blawin' cauld, an' he's dreepit thro' an' thro' ;
He' s spierin' for his mither, an' he winners whaur she's gane;
But, oh ! his mither she forgets her puir wee raggit wean.
He kens na faither's love, an' he kens nae mither's care,
To soothe his wee bit sorrows, or kame his tauted hair,
To kiss him when he waukens, or smooth his bed at e'en;
An' oh ! he fears his father's face—the drunkard's raggit
wean.

O pity the wee laddie, sae guileless an' sae young,
The oath that lea's the father's lip 'ill settle on his tongue,
An' sinfu' words his mither speaks his infant lips 'ill stain ;
For oh ! there's nane to guide the bairn—the drunkard's
raggit wean.
Then surely we micht try an' turn that sinfu' mithers heart,
An' try to get his faither to act a faither's part;
An' mak' them lea' the drunkard's cup, an' never taste again,
Ah' cherish wi' a parent's care their puir wee raggit wean.
