THE DESTRUCTION OF ABERCROMBIE !

ABERCROMBIE came down like a wolf on the' fold,
And his pockets were furnish'd with Devonshire gold ;
And his pale senseless face was as fearful to see,
As the dark troubl'd wave on the deep Galilee.

Like the leaves of the forest, when summer is green.
The WHIGS in the morn with their banners were seen ;
Like the leaves of the forest, when autumn hath blown,
That host on the morrow lay wither'd and strewn.

For the breath of the Union came strong on the blast,
And bung'd up the CHIEF BARON'S eye as it pass'd ;
And the hopes of the Whiglings began to grow chill,
And their hearts quacked for fear, and their voices were
still.

And there fell (The BARBER) his nostril all wide,
With his brandy and opium half-used by his side;
And sheriffless IVORY lay soft on the turf,
As cold as the spray on the rock-beating surf.

There lay GIBSON-CRAIG, distorted and pale,
And ugly Sir JOHN, with a face like a tail;
LAUDER DICK grew more yellowâ€”BOBBY THOMSON was
dumb!! !
And NAPIER MACVRY looked as frighten'd as BUM.

And MILLIGAN'S ladies are loud in their wail,
That their customer FRANK has been forc'd to turn tail;
And the hopes of the WHIGS are gloomy and drear,
When they think of the " Pipe " and " Two Thousand
a-year."
