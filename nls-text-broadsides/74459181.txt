Guid evenin' frien's,  I hope your weel,

So i've just come tae see you frien's
An' bid ye a' guid bye.

CHORUS—

Fareweel,fareweel i'am gaun awa' tae leave you,
Come doon tae the beac, and see me safe adoat,
Eerly in the mornin, when the licht of day is dawuin',
A sail across the ocean in a big steam boat.

Last nieht a wheen o' chaps did meet,
To wish me guid speed,
Tae help  tae Keep oor spirits up,
We had a guid stiff fead;
We sang and joked the hale nicht lang,
We had a jolly spree :
I'll aye keep mind o' that blaw oot,
when far across the sea.

Spoken.—I, it was a rare shine we had, there wis a'thing that wis
wanted Rum , Whisky, Beer, tea& Lemonade, for the Teatoatle-
bodies. Ye Keu an  wid ye    bleave there wis a man there that stunch
T. T. that, he widna let his  canary B rd drink oot o'a dram-glass.
I amn' when we were comin hame Casey and me, thats a' mate o' mine,
we baith work wi', Mrs.  Mac Pherson,Hay & Straw Merchant.  Yin
O' they greedy screamin' auld bodies ye ken., weel their was ae Mor-
nin' Casey cam runnin' in a out o' beath aboot ten minuts past 6, an
he says, "Mrs. Mac Pherson, I had a dream last nicht" An what
was you drem  aboot Casey , o says he, "I thocht  that  that you gie'd
me a pound o' Tea and the Master gie'd me six pound o' Sugar, for
my my birthday present,.' bat says she, ' Die ye ken that dreams are
aye contrary, weel says Casey, "The Maste I'll gaun tae gie me the
Tea and you the Sugar. ' I weel he was. a fine  kind-hart'd chap
was Casey, weel the twa o's comin hame as, was sayin', an we were
lilten a bit sang we neard yin o' the lasses singin at the spree. What
was it o' aye, 'Oor H[ ] is Hay [ ]et butt nat oor hearts." when
the cirb tean oor feet an' s[  ]p,' gaed the twa o' os'on the plane stane,
but a faithful ever ready for the ocaison cam forret. an' lifted Casey
up, an' he says, 'D, you hear m[  ]  do you hear man dis she'll ken far she'll be." no says Casey 
"you're leanin' on the Bank of Scotland.
weelsays I, " That the  first time ever I  kent that place to support
that man," but I drew a half mutchken bottle oot o' ma pouch here
says  I "Tak'' a drink o' that an' he did, their was nae teeth awa-
ntin' in his head one way an then says he, "what areyou twa chaps."
o says i, 'Baith caarters ,"but says he, " what are ye tae principle,"
o says i, "sometimes Liberal, sometimes concertive, an' on sater-
day nicht a Spiritliast, an on Sunday mornin' snar tae be a Shaker,"
an says he ''What wil l ye cae them that brings in yer mornin' ," On
says I, Salvatonest,' so I took guid bye o' the booby and Casey an
me cam awa. Singing-Chorus.
 
If back tae bonny Scotland,
1 should ever chance tae roam,
I hope tae find ye a' quite weel.
When tae this toon i come.
And if it is my fortune,
To spend life's closing day,
Amang my native heather hills,
You'il never hear  me say.
