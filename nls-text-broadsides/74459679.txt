THE SEA !

The sea !   the sea !   the open sea !
The blue, the fresh, the ever free !
Without a mark, without a bound,
It runneth the earth's wide regions round.
It plays with the clouds, it mocks the sky,
Or like a cradled creature lies.
I'm on the sea !   I'm on the sea'.
I am where I would ever be ;
With the blue above, and the sea below,
And silence prevails whereso'er I go.
If a storm should come & awake the deep,
What matter, I shall ride and sleep.
What matter, &c.

I loveâ€”oh, how I love to ride,
On the fierce, foaming, bunsting tide !
When every mad wave drowns the moon,
Or whistles aloft the tempest tune !
And tells how goeth the world below,
And why the south-west blast doth blow.
I never was on the dull tame shore,
But I lov'd the great sea more and more ;
And backward flew to her billowy breast,
Like a bird that seeke h its mother's nest;
And a mother she was, and is to me,
For I was born on the open sea.
For I was born, &c.

The waves were white, and red the morn,
In the noisy hour when I was born;
And the whale it whistled, the porpoise

roll'd,

The Dolphins bared their backs of gold;
And never was heard such an outcry wild,
As welcom'd to life the ocean child.
I have liv'd since then in calm and strife,
Full fifty summers a rover's life,
With wealth to spend, & a power to lend,
But never sought or sigh'd for change ;
And death, whenever be comes to me,
Shall come on the wild unbounded sea.
And death, &c.
