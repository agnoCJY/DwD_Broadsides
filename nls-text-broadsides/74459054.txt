AYTOUN the Union Laddie.

AIR.—The New Highland Laddie.

The Whigs think they are grand and great,
But O ' they're proud and idly gaudy.
How much unlike the manly gait
Of Aytoun our dear Union Laddie !
	O my charming Union Laddie,
	Our meet and graceful Union Laddie ;
	What man would e'er a Whig compare
	With Aytoun our dear Union Laddie !

There's Gibson high above the whole,
I doubt he'll prove a Whig dissembler,
Though long enough to stand for the poll,
He'd ful  far short of a proper member.
	O my charming Union Laddie,
	My sweet and Sonsie Union Laddie;
	The proper size to please all eyes,
	Is Aytoun our dear Union Laddie.

There's Jeffry who in Stephen's, Hall,
Broke down so sadly—what a pity !—
It's my belief the man's too small,
To represent so great a city,
	O my charming Union Laddie,
	My fine high sounding Union Laddie ;
	When he gets there he'll make them stare,
	For none can match my Union Laddie,

Then as for him who stands for Leith,
His name—'twould not be right to mention,
But this I'll tell him to his teeth,
If he wants for votes he'll drop his pension.
	O my charming Union Laddie,
	My true and honest Union Laddie ;
	No post or place to his disgrace
	Has Aytoun our sweet Union Laddie.

See Aytoun on some grand field day,
With flags unfurled and ribbons streaming,
Like minute guns his words make way,
Through sixty thousand men and women !
	O my charming Union Laddie,
	My loud persuasive Union Laddie ;
	There's none so rare in the open air
	Can speak like my dear Union Laddie.

Then the Chief Baron doth appear,
A man more barren see'd I  never,
But he draws two thousand Pounds a year,
For doing nothing whatsomever.
	O my charming Union Laddie,
	My poor but honest Union Laddie;
	No pension sure nor sinecure,
	Has Aytoun our dear Union Laddie.

The Whigs humbug and speak ye fine,
Though in their hearts they scorn and hate ye,
But Aytoun is the genuine,
'Tis he's the proper clean potaty.
	O my charming Union Laddie,
	My sweet Delightful Union Laddie ;
	No paltry sham but the real yam,
	Is Aytoun our dear Union Laddie.

If Aytoun's chosen I'll be bound,
When duty calls he'll never flinch it;
He'll stand to what he does lay down,
And if its to be done he'll clinch it.
	O my steady Union Laddie,
	My stainch and stedfast Union Laddie;
	There's none so bold for to behold,
	As Aytoun our good union Laddie.

Then when the Parliaments disolved,
Which it's said 'twill be before November,
With heart and soul we've all resolved,
Aytoun shall be the people's member.
	O my charming union Laddie,
	My darling comely union Laddie ;
	A plumper vote we'll each allot,
	To Aytoun our dear union Laddie.
