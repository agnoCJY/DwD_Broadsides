A

POEM

On the  RACE of Leith, Oc
tober, Twenty Second.

To   the   Praise    of the
HIGHLAND LADIE

I HEAR a Horse Race lately Run,
Was into Leith where no Man wan
Untill a Highland Ladie
Came up foremost with a Bay Brown,
Which all thought was a Jad,

Next after him came Fedbrugh's Horse,
Whom all Man thought could ne're
And afrer came 'Squair Lyle, (loss.
Who thought as he had done before ;
His Nage would never spoil.

But like a Jad he sell behind,
And never could the right Foot find.
Neither for Spur, nor yet for Bridle,
So that to bring his York-shire here,:
Thinking to carr'd off fairlie.

Scots Lads & their Bay-Broun-Nages,
Thinks nothing of the York-shire,
But Run them down all over,
Altho they think for to prevail,
Yet they come last of all,

And Lyle that won't to be the first,
Comes now next almost to the last,
And can not his Horse recover.
Therefore I hope He'l never strive
To  Run with Scots Horse after,

Again because our Scots Horse be
Swifter than the Yorkshire Gray,
Who boast of gaining Races,
    In any Ground where they are  found
Yet come off with short Paces
