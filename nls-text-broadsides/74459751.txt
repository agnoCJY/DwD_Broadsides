WAES    ME    FOR

PRINCE  CHARLIE

AIR—Bonny  House o' Airley.

A wee bird cam to our ha' door,
It warbled sweet and clearly ;
And aye the o'ercome o' its sang,
Was  "Waes me for Prince Charlie!"
O, when I heard the bonnie sound,
My heart maist burstet fairley,
I took the bonnet aff my head,
For weel  I lov'd Prince Charlie.

On hills that are by right his ain,
He roams a lonely stranger ;
On every side he's press'd by want—
On every side is danger :
Yestreen I met him in a Glen,
My heart maist burstet fairley
For sadly chang'd indeed was he,
O, waes me for Prince Charlie !

Dark night came on, the tempest roar'd
Loud o'er the hills and valleys;
And where was't your Prince lay down,
Whase hame should be a palace?
He row'd him in his Highland plaid,
That cover'd him but sparely ;
He slept beneath a bush o' broom:
O, waes me for Prince Charlie !

The wee bird saw some red-coats come,
He shook his wings wi' anger,
Saying, "This is no the land for me,
I'll tarry here nae langer.''
It hovered on the wing awhile,
Ere it departed fairley;
But weel I mind the farewell strain,
Was waes me for Prince Charlie !
