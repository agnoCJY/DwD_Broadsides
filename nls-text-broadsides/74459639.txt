The Northern DITTY;



Or the SCOTCHMAN Outwitted by a Country DAMSEL

COLD and raw the North did blow,
 Bleak in the morning early;
All the trees were hid with snow,
Covered with winter early.
As I was riding over the Slough,
  I met a farmer's Daughter,
With rosy cheeks and bonny brow,
Good faith my chops did water.  
Down I wav'd my bonnet low,
Meaning to shew my breeding,
She return'd a graceful bow,
Her visage far exceeding.
I asked her where she was going so soon,

 And long'd to hold a parley ;
She told me to the next market town,
On purpose to sell her barley. 
In this purse, sweet soul, said I,
Twenty pounds lie fairly,
Seek no farther one to buy,

For Ise take all thy barley.
And twenty pounds more shall purchase
Thy person I love so dearly,     (delight
If tbou wilt lig with me all night,
And gang home in the morning early,
If forty pounds would say the globe,
This thing I would not do, Sir,
Or were my friends as poor as JOB,
I'd never raise them so, Sir.
For would you prove one night my friend

Wese get a young kid together,
And you'd be gone e'er nine months end,

Then where should  I find the father ?
Pray what would my father say,

If I should be so silly
To throw my maidenhead away,

And lose my true love Billy.

O  this would bring me to disgrace,
And therefore I say you Nay, Sir,

But if that you will me embrace,
First marry, and then you may, Sir,

I told her I had married been,

Fourteen years and longer,
Else I'd chuse you for my Queen,

And fasten the knot stronger,
She bid me then no farther roam,

But manage my wedlock fairly,

And keep my purse for spouse at home,
For some other should buy her barley.
Then swift as any roe,                 
She rode away and left me;
And after her I could not go,
   Of  joy she quite bereft me,
Thus I myself did disappoint,

For she did leave me fairly,
My words knock'd all things of of joint,

I lost both the maid and barley.
RIDING down a narrow lane,

Some two or three hours after,
There I chanc'd to meet again

This bonny farmer's daughter :
Altho' it was both raw and cold,

I staid to hold a parley,
And shew'd once more my purse of gold,

When she had sold her barley.
Love, said I, pray do not frown,

But let us change embraces,
I'll buy thee silken gown,

With ribbons, gloves, and laces,
A ring and bodkin, muff, and fan,

No lady shall have neater ;

For as I am an honest man ;

I ne'er saw a sweeter creature.
Then I took her by the hand,   

And said, My dearest jewel,
Why shouldest thou disputing stand,

I pray thee be not cruel. 
She found my mind was fully bent,

To pleasure my fond desire,
Therefore  she seemed to consent,

But I wish'd I had ne'er come nigh her
Sir, said she, what shall I do,

If I commit this evil,
And yeild myself love to you,

I hope you will be civil,
You talk of ribbons, gloves, and rings,
And likewise gold and treasure,

O let me first enjoy these things
Then you shall have your pleasure,

Sure thy will shall be obey'd be obey'd,

Said I, my own dear honey;
Then into her lap I laid

Full forty pounds in money:
We'll to the market town this day,
And straitway end this quarrel,
And deck thee like a lady gay,

In flourishing apparel.
All my gold and Silver there

To her I did deliver,
On the road we did repair,

Out coming to a river,
Whose waters were both deep and wide,

Such rivers I ne'er saw many;
She leapt her mare on the other side,

And left me not one penny:           

Then my heart was sung full low,

With grief and care surrounded:
After her I could not go,   

For fear of being drowned :
She turn'd about, and said behold,

I am not for your devotion ;
But Sir, I thank you for your gold,

'T will help to enlarge my portion.

I began to stamp and stare,

To see what she had acted;
With my hand I tore my hair,

Like one that was quite distracted.
Give me my money then I cry'd,

Good faith I did but lend it;
But she full fast away did ride,

And vow'd she did not intend it.
