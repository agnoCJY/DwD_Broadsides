BE MINE, DEAR MAID.

Be mine, dear maid, this faithful heart,
Can never prove untrue ;
'Twere easier far from life to part,
Than cease to live for you !

Then turn thee not away, my love ;
Oh ! turn thee not away :
For by the light of truth I swear !
To love thee night and day, love !
To love thee night and day !
To love thee, to love thee !
To love thee night and day, love !

The lark shall first forget to sing,
When morn unfolds the east ;
E'er I, by change or coldness, wring
Thy fond confiding breast !
Oh ! turn thee not away, &c.

AMANG THE RIGS O' BARLEY.

It was upon a Lammas night,
When corn rigs are bonny,
Beneath the moon's unclouded light,
I held awa' to Annie ;
The time flew by wi' tentless heed,
Till 'tween the late and early,
Wi' sma' persuasion she agreed
To see me through the barley.

Corn rigs, and barley rigs,
An' corn rigs are bonny ;
I'll ne'er forget that happy night,
Amang the rigs wi' Annie.

The sky was blue, the wind was still,
The moon was shining clearly ;
I set her down, wi' right good will
Amang the rigs o' barley ;
I kent her heart was a' my ain ;
I lo'ed her most sincerely ;
I kiss'd her o'er and o'er again,
Amang the rigs o' barley.

I lock'd her in my fond embrace ;
Her heart was beating rarely ;
My blessings on that happy place
Amang the rigs o' barley.
But by the moon and stars sae bright,
That shone that hour sae clearly ;
She aye shall bless that happy night,
Amang the rigs o' barley.

DUMBARTON'S BONNIE DELL.

There's ne'er a nook in a' the land
That William rules sae well,
There's naething half sae canty, grand,
As blythe Dumbarton's dell ;
And would you speer the reason why,
The truth I'll fairly tell,
A winsome lassock lives hard by
Dumbarton's bonnie dell

Up by yon glen, Loch-Lomond laves,
Where bold M' Gregors dwelly ;
And bogles dance o'er heroes' graves,
There lives Dumbarton's belle ;
She's blest with every charm in life,
And this I know full well—
I'll ne'er he happy till my wife
Is blythe Dumbarton's belle.

HIGHLAND MARY.

Ye banks, and braes, and streams around,
The Castle o' Montgomery,
Green be your woods and fair your flowers,
Your waters never drumlie !
There simmer first unfaulds her robes,
And there they langest tarry ;
And there I took the last farewell,
Of my sweet Highland Mary.

How sweetly bloom'd the gay green birk,
How rich the hawthorn's blossom,
As underneath their fragrant shade,
I clasp'd her to my bosom ?
The golden hours, on angel wings,
Flew o'er me and my dearie—
For dear to me as light and life,
Was my dear Highland Mary.

Wi' mony a vow and lock'd embrace,
Our parting was fu' tender ;
And pledging aft to meet again,
We tore ourselves asunder.
But oh ! fell death's untimely frost,
That nipt my flower so early !
Now green's the sod, and cauld's the clay,
That wraps my Highland Mary!

O pale, pale now those rosy lips,
I aft hae kiss'd sae fondly!
And clos'd for aye, the sparkling glance,
That dwelt on me sae kindly!
And mouldering now in silent dust,
The heart that lo'ed me dearly !
But still within my bosom's core,
Shall live my Highland Mary.
