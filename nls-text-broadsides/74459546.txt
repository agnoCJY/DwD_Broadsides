   THE

DOWNFALL

OF

SPITTAL!

A NEW SONG.
Tune—" WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY."

I.

COME join in my chorus, true Aytounites all,
And sing of our triumph and SPITTAL'S down-fall,
For altho' to the Whigs it be wormwood and gall,
Yet the Draper must certainly go to the wall—
Which nobody can deny, deny,
Which nobody can deny.

II.

Of ECONOMY now he may drivel and drawl,
But the thousand a-year we must always recall—
So under his counter he'd much better crawl,
In case he be tossed in a blanket or shawl—
Which nobody can deny, deny,
Which nobody can deny.

III.

What altho' thro' the streets lying ballads they
squall,
In praise of his shop, and his seat, Justice-Hall,
While they swagger, and bluster, and bellow, and
bawl,
JAMIE AYTOUN, as Provost, we'll quietly install—
Which nobody can deny, deny,
Which nobody can deny.

IV.

Tho' GIBSON may stand 'mong the people like Saul,
And JEFF look still bigger, though hardly so tall,
Yet when spirits like ours they pretend to enthrall,
They'll speedily find that they both must sing small,
Which nobody can deny, deny,
Which nobody can deny.

V.

SPITTAL tells us we're low ; and he fain would
miscall
The Cowgate and Bow, 'cause they dare to black-
ball
A pert little Draper ; but yet after all,
If he is so high, so much greater his fall—
Which nobody can deny, deny,
Which nobody can deny.

VI.

But my rhymes, they are finished; so now, once
for all,
Let us sing in full chorus to Spittal's down-fall;
Jamie Gibson will play us " the dead march in
Saul,"
And Black will be happy to carry the pall—
Which nobody can deny, deny,
Which nobody can deny.
