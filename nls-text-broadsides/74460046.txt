AN

ELEGY

Upon the Exceeding much to be Lamented Death
of the Illustrious Princess ANNE Dutches of
HAMILTON, Who Departed this Life the 16th.
of October 1716, in the 96th. Year of her Age

THIS Noble  Princess of Immortal Fame,
An Ornament unto the Chtistian Name ;
More Vertues than we're able to express,
By Constellations did her Breast posses;
Unbyass'd Zeal, and decent Modesty,
Prudence, Patience,  Love and Charity ;
Nay, spotless Chastity and Fortitude,
Humility, and evr'y Thing   that's good,
Adorn'd this most Illustrious  Princess's Mind
And in her Nothing that is bad we find:
No Dusk of Vice her Heavenly Breast did taint,
Or Passion unbecoming any Saint;
The main Character of a Saint we find,
Illust'rously shine in her Noble Mind;
Ev'n Chanty in an extended Sense,
In suff'ring long   an unprovoked Offence,
Construing well of Actions done amiss,
And lib'ral Bounty to all in Distress,
The Widows, Orphants, Poor and Fatherless,
Her Grace's Hand found ope for their Releif.
 And all she could, did to asswage their Grief.
With all afflicted she did sympathize,
And from her Hand they always found Supplies ;
Heav'n blest her with a Talent, and she did
Improve the fame, and not her Talent hid;
Much Earthly Wealth this Princess did posses,
But Share therein had all the Fatherless
As she had Access, and their Cafe did know,
No needy Soul did from her empty go.
She  cloath'd the Naked, and the  Hungry fed,
And made the Hearts of helpless Orphants glad.
And as the Needy now adays are throng,
Heav'n for  their Sakes her Life preserved long;
Ev'n much beyond the common Term of Years
That others live, leaving the World in Tears,
At least so much thereof as knew her Grace,
And shar'd her Bounty near her dwelling Place,
That to them she some Comfort might afford ;
But at the last,  it now has pleas'd the L O R D,
To take her hence unto his Place of  Glore,
Loaded with Blessings of the starving Poor,
Who in this World can have her Help no more.
This Debt to Nature all of us must pay,
And therefore ought prepare for such a Day,
When Earthly  Comforts can no Comfort yeild,
Nor be against the Darts of Death a Sheild :
Let us lament this Princess Loss, and strive,
That where she is we may at last  arrive
In Heav'nly Mansions, and Eternal Joy,
Where Nothing  doth disturb, or cause anoy.
