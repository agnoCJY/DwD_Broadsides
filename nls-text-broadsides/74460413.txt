REFORM

   BILL.





AN anonymous PLACARD having been
stuck up in various places, stating that the
REFORM BILL had been read a third time
and passed in the House of Lords, without any
opposition, " excepting from the EARL OF HADDINGTON and the DUKE OF BUCCLEUGH ;" the
Public are reminded that these Noblemen did

not oppose the principle of the Bill,

but only one of its provisions limiting the 

Representatives for SCOTLAND to a smaller number, by Eight or Ten, than the population (to say nothing of the wealth and intel-
ligence of that Conntry when compared and
contrasted with England,) entitled her to
have. It is therefore obvious, that both
Noblemen acted from motives the most patriotic and upright, and have justly deserved the

Thanks of their Countrymen

in place of the opprobrium sought to be fixed
upon them by the nameless author of the above
insiduous Notice, whose drift is seen through
with half an eye. 



VOTERS.

BEWARE OF SUCH PITIFUL ATTEMPTS TO EXCITE
YOUR PREJUDICE, AGAINST THE NOBLE AND
HIGHLY TALENTED YOUNG CANDIDATE NOW
SOLICITING YOUR SUPPORT.
