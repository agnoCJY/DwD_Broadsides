Lamentation

OF

GEORGE GIECHRiST,. who is to be Executed at Edinburgh, on
Wednesday morning the 3d. August instant for the Robbing of
the Prince Regent Coach, between Edinburgh and Glasgow, on
the 24th. of March 1831.

O all who hear of my sad state,
Oh pity my dire case,
Doomed to an ignominious fate,
Deprived of human bhss.

O if my days were to begin,
I to the world would shew,
That I would shun the paths of sin,
Wherein destroyers go.

But ah ! these days are past and gone !
In fetters here I lye,
Confined in a dungeon strong,
By men condemned to die.

Because GOD'S law I did transgress,
And would not walk therein :
But fled the paths of righteousness,
And trod the paths of sin.

My sentence sure it must be just,
For the commandment says,
Thou shalt not steal ; thou never must—
Thou'lt fare as thou obeys.

The law of GOD is strict against
All such enormous crimes ;
And sure these laws they do extend
To men of different crimes.

Tormenting thoughts oppress my heart,
While I think on my ways ;
More piercing they're than sharped darts,
That have cut short my days.

And sure the vengeance it will come,
And on my head will fall,                
Unless that GOD'S own holy Son          
Deliver me from thrall.                     

O therefore holy Jesus come                
And shield me from the wrath,
That from thy Father forth is gone,
To crush us into death.

O therefore holy Son of GOD,              
Do thou my soul relieve,
From GOD'S wrath and affiicting rod,
That now my soul doth grieve.

On thy redemption I depend;
O cast me not away ;
But shield my soul, and me defend
Against the evil day.                        

And then of death's devouring pangs
    I will not be afraid ;
 When thou by thine own righteous laws
    My righteousness hast made,

Good Christians all of every kind,
    Who hear of my sad fate,
Repent and sanctify your mind,
Before it is too late.

Remember, Lord, how short a time,
    On earth I've to remain,
And when I suffer for my crime,
   May death to me be gain.



O let the prisoner's sighs ascend,
Before thy throne on high,
Likewise frome death their souls defend,
    That are condemned to die.

So that with you it may be well,
    When you resign your breath,
And may with saints and angels  dwell,
    Free from the second death.



O then give ea  to what I say,
    Seek GOD to be your guide :
Resort not with bad company,
    And truth keep on your side.

New to conclude, O Lord  my God,
    I humbly do thee pray
When that the path of death I've trod.
    Thou'lt take my spirit away.



Good people all think on my fate,
    Do not go in my ways !
Adieu to every worldly thing.
    And so I end my days.

For if you suffer passions strong,
To triumph over you,
They'll hurry you to hell amongst,
The lost and guilty crew.

Who've trampled on GoD'S holy laws,
And cast his precepts all behind,
For wickedness to blindness draws,
And blindness leads astray the blind.

Join prayers with me, good chirstians all
For the salvation of my soul,
That I may never go to dwell,
In darkness black and foul.
