O, whaur gat ye that bonnie blue bonnet,
O, silly, blind body, canna' ye see;
I gat it frae a bonny Scots callan',
'Atween Saint Johnstone and bonny Dundee.

CHORUS.
An' 0, gin I saw but the  laddie that gae
me't,
Fu' aft has he dandl'd me upon his knee;
But noo he's awa, an' I dinna ken whaur
he's,
O, gin he "was back to his minny an' me.

My heart has nae room when I think on  my
dawty,                                               
His dear, rosy haffits bring tears in my e'e;
But noo he 's awa', an' I dinna ken whar he 's;
Gin we could ance meet we 'se ne'er part till
we dee.
