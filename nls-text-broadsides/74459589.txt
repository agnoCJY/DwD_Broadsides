The  Lawland Lads think they are fine, But   O  they're  vain  and     idly  gawdy,How





much unlike  that graceful   Mien,   and manly  Looks   of my    Highland   Laddie:

O my bonny Highland Laddie, my handsome  smiling Highland Laddie may heav'n  still

guard and  love reward. the Lawland Lass and her   Highland   Laddie.

If  I   were   free   at    will   to   chuse
 To be   the   wealthiest  Lawland   Lady
Id  take young DONALD  without Trews,
With  Bonnet blue and   belted   Plaidy.
O  my bonny &c.

The brawest Beau in,  Borrows  Town.        
In a his  Airs with Arts  made ready,
Compair'd to him hes   but a   Clown.
He's  finer far in's   tartan  Plaidy .
O   my  bonny  &c.

O'er benty Hill with him I'll   run.
And leave my  Lawland Kin and Dady,
Frae Winters   Cauld       and  Summers   Sun
He'll sereen me with his Highland Plaidy
O my bonny &c.

A   painted    Room   and   silken   Bed,
May please a Lawland Laird and Lady.
But. I can  kiss   and be  as   glad,
Behind a Bush   in's Highland  Plaidy.
O my bonny &c.

             6

I ca'  him my dear Highland laddie.
And he ca's. me  his   Lawland Lass,
Sine rows me in beneath his Plaidy.
O   my bonny &c.


                        7
Nae greater Joy Ill  e'er pretend
Than that his Love prove true and steady
Like mine to him which ne'er shall end
While Heavn preserve my Highland  Laddie.
O my bonny &c.
