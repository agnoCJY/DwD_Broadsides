THE Dark-hair'd Girl.

Oh, my dark-hair'd girl, your ringlets deck
In silked curls your graceful neck;
Your neck is like the swan, and pure as the pearl,
And diamonds are thy eyes, Oh, my dark-hair'd girl.

Oh, my dark-hair'd girl, you have promised me,
And I my vows have paid to thee;
And Oh, I would not change for the crown of an earl
The price of being loved by my dark-hair'd girl.

Oh, my dark-hair'd girl, the dainty bee
Upon thy lip might wish to sip;
Thy cheeks are like the rose, thy teeth they are pearl,
And diamonds are thy eyes, Oh, my dark-hair'd girl.


The Moon.

How beautiful and how serene,
Shines, yonder, Night's resplendent Queen,
Kindly to comfort those who roam,
And light the trav'ller to his home!

Oh: thou, whose beams so sweetly play;
Bestow one kind, one cheering ray;
One sympathetic gleam impart,
To heal the anguish in my heart.
