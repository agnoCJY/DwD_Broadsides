A CONGRATULATORY POEM
Upon the Happy Nuptials of the Right Honourable

CHARLES HOPE of Hopetoun,

And the Very Vertuous LADY

 HENRIETTA JOHNSTON

Daughter to the Right Honourable the Earl of  ANN AND ALE, Which was
solemnized  on the 31st. of August, 1699.

IN Autumn when Seges decores the Fields,
And Ph√¶bus all plentiful Desires yeelds.
These Creatures who did formerly bewail
Their hard Estate, sing now in Annandale,  

 There's Hope that Heavens will crown the year with good
And Hoptoun blest with all manner of Food.  
Whilst Sun and Moon endure,  so that there may
Never be Want of Hope that Grace, decay.
For 'tis by Hope, That Love and Charity
Are still upheld, without it both do dye.
May Hoptoun flourish still with Lady Hen-
Rietta, and have a Stock of good Children,
That thro' all Ages, there may never fail
The Memory of Hope and Annandale. 

Whose Noble Fame doth add to Hopton's  Honour,
He being by good Fate bestow'd upon Her.
Who like, to Flora in Spring of the Year,     
Sends forth a Fragrant Smell both far and near,
To the Solace of all that See or Hear. 
Of these choice Virtues wherewith her tender Breast
Is richly endu'd wherein true Hope doth rest,
And full Assurance may always obtain       
Of human Pleasure, Beauty pure and clean.
Her Noble Predecessors ever have  

Prov'd in all Ages Pious, Wise and Grave,
And famous in such actions as might tend 
Their Countrey's Good, and Int'rest to defend.
So, all who know the Bridegroom and the Bride,
Hope they Will prove in time ( if Good betide )
Which is the hearty Pray'r of Muses, when
They are encourag'd Virtue's Praise to pen.
But if they find their Labour quite neglected
To pray or praise they cease, being dejected.
Yet still there's Hope they may revive again,
And not always improve their time in vain.
