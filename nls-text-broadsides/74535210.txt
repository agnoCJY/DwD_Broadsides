A ROUSE ! arouse ! ilk kilted clan,
Let Highland  hearts lead on the van,
Forward wi' her dirk in hand,
To fight for royal Charlie.

Welcome, Charlie, o'er the main, 
The Highland hills are a' your ain,
Welcome to your ain again,
Welcome, royal Charlie.

Auld Scotia's sons 'mong Highland hills,
Can nobly brave the face o' ills ;
For kindred fire ilk bosom fills,
At sight o' royal Charlie.
		Welcome, Charlie, &c,

Her ancient Thistle wags her pow,
And proudly wags o'er dale and known,
To her the oath and sacred row,
We'll live or die wi' Charlie.
		Welcome, Charlie, &c.

Rejoiced to think nae foreign weed
Shall trample on her hardy seed,
For weel she kens her sons will bleed,
Or fix his throne right fairly.
		Welcome, Charlie, &c.

Among the wilds o' Caledon,
Breathes there a base degenerate son,
Who would not to his standard run.
And rally round Prince Charlie.
		Welcome,Charlie, &c.

Then let the flowing quench go round,
And boldly bid the pibrock sound,
Till every glen and rock resound,
The name o' royal Charlie.
		Welcome, Charlie, &c,
