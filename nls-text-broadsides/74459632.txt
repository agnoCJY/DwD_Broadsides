THE NEW POLICE.


I'M one of the new police, egad,
The servant maids declare,
There's not a chap in all the force,
Can sturt with such an air;
My gloves of white, my coat of blue,
My dignity increase,
And every gesture shows to you.
That I'm one of the new police.

I'm partial to an outside beat,
For there I feel secure,
Then with the servant maids I romp,
And play at some back door;
I love to loll in kitchens too,
Some mutton joints to fleece,
I'm never in the want of prog,
Cause I'm one of the new police.

'Tis pleasant when I peckish feel,
With Moll and Bess to stop,
When fat cooks they do go below,
And broil a mutton chop;
Large rounds of beef I gaze upon,
Just wink and earn a peace,
I'd rather than a Burrow chap,
Be one of the new police.

I used to live on low lobscouse,
I was foolish—I'd no sense,—
I now live like a fighting cock,
With small or no expense;
I was a journeyman tailor then,
But now I'm in the peace,
I sturt about, break, heads, egad,
For I'm one of the new police.

But oh, 'tis growing late, and time
That I was on my beat,
But, ere I go, this short advice,
Now here I do entreat;
Your Sunday walks and moonlight strols,
And all your sports shall cease,
For recreation wont be allow'd
Not by the new police.

These publicans have such a dread
Whene'er the hour gets late,
My very strut does make them quake,
When I am on my beat,
I'll levy fines whener I can,
In fact I'll never cease,
I will torment them night and day,
Since I've got in the new police.
