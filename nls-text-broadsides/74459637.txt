The New Way,

O F . T HE 

Bonny  Highland Laddie.'

To it's own 'Proper-Tune &c.

I Crossed Forth, I crossed Tay,
I left Dundee, and Edinborrow,
I saw nothing there worth my Stay,
and so I bad them all Good-morrow.
O my bonny, bonny HighlandLaddie,
O my bonny, bonny Highland Laddie,
When I am sick and like to dye,
Thou'lt row me in thy Highland Pladie'

For on the Cairnamount I spy'd,
in careless Dress a Highland Laddie,
Who briskly said were' t thou my Bride,
I drew thee in my Highland Pladie,
O my bonny, bonny, &c.

No Butter-Box he seem'd to be,
no English-Fop, no Low and Laddie,
But by his mein he was well known,
to be some Gentle Highland Laddie.
O my bonny, bonny, &c.

His Quiver hang down by his Thigh,
his Mein did shew his Bow was ready,
A thousand Darts flew from his Eye,
and all fell down before his Lady.
O my bonny, bonny, &c.

It's Silken Rooms and Pearled Beds.
and laced Shoes fit for a Lady;
But he can do't as wantonly,
in Highland Trews  and belted Plade
O my bonny, bonny, &c,

I will have no Commander Man,
Captain, Col'nel, nor a Caddie,
If all my Friends had sworn and said,
I'll have none but a Highland Laddie.
O my bonny, bonny. &c,

But when we came to Stirling Town,
he promised to make me a Lady,
But all the Tocher that I got,
he row'd me in his Highland Pladie.
O my bonny, bonny HighlandLaddie,
O my bonny, bonny Highland Laddie,
When I am sick and like to dye,
He'll row me in his Highland Plaidie.

FINIS.
