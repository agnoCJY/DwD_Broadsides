TUNE-Original.

Thy voice is near me in my dreams,
In accents sweet and low,
Telling of happiness and love,
In days long, long ago.
Word after word I think I hear,
Yet strange it seems to me,
That though I listen to thy voice,
Thy face I never see.
Thy face I never see,
Thy face I never see,
That though I listen to thy voice,
Thy face I never see.

From night to night my weary heart
Lives on the treasur'd past,
And ev'ry day I fondly say,
He'll come to me at last.
But still I weep, I watch and pray,
As time runs slowly on,
And yet I have no hope but thee,
The first, the dearest one.
The first, the dearest one,
The first, the dearest one,
And yet I have no hope but thee,
The first, the dearest one.
