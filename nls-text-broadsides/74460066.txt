An IMITATION of the 137. Psalm.

ON Gallia's Shore we fat and wept,
When Scotland we thought on,
Rob'd of her bravest Sons; and all
Her ancient Spirit gone.                       

"Revenge, (the Sons of Gallia said) 
" Revenge your native Land :                            
" Already your insulting Foes             
" Croud the Batavian Strand."       

How shall the Son of Freedom e'er   
For foreign Conquest fight ?       ,     
For Power how wield the Sword, unsheath'd
For Liberty and Right ?           

If thee,O Scotland, I forget,
Even with my latest Breath;
May foul Dishonour stain my Name,        
And bring a Coward's Death.   

May sad Remorse of fancy'd Guilt
My. future Days employ,                  
If all thy sacred  Rights are not
Above my chiefest  Joy.       

Remember England's Children, Lord,
Who, on Drumossie Day,
Deaf to the Voice of kindred Love
" Raze, raze it quite," did say.

And thou, proud Gallia, faithless Friend,
Whose Ruin is not far,
Just Heaven on thy devoted Head
Pour all the Woes of War.

When thou thy slaughter'd little ones,
And ravish'd Dames, shalt see;
Such Help! such Pity! may'st thou have,
As Scotland had from thee.
