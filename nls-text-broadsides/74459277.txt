Auld John Tamson rade hame frae the fair

Late, late on o cauld winter night O!
He had toomed his three coggies, an' mebbe ane mair,

Nae ferlie, his head it was light O !
But his horse kenn'd the gate, sae John lay in the cart;

Sleeping as sound as a tap, O!
An' the horse draigled on tho' the sleet and the clart,

While Jonnie lay takin' his nap O!

At length, at the foot of a steep an' stey brae,

Auld Bawsie drew breath an' stood still O!
An' dozin' fell driming o' sweet scented hay,

While Jock dremt o' rich reamin yill, O !
John Tamson's guidwife cam' her liege lord tae seek,

Wi' a bowit that shone like a star, O!
For, though she had lectured him week after week,

He grew aye the langer the waur, O!

My certie, quo' she, "but I'll play him a fleg,

As sure as Jean Tamson's my name, O
Sae frae the cart trams she lowsed the auld naig,

An' slippit it strauoht awa' hame, O
The wind it blew bleak, and John Tamson awoke,

An' he hyted an' hupped in vain, O
He ferlied what gar'd his horse Stan' like a stick,

Till he graipit an' felt it was gane, O.

Syne back Me the toll in a harry he rau,

An' the tollman he wauked in a fricht, O
"Can I be John Tamson ? come tell me, guidman,

Hae John Tamson passed by the nicht, O ?
"Guid help us man Jock, is't yoursel' or your ghost ?

The tollman he cried wi' a start, O
"Gin 1 be John Tamson, a horse I hae lost,

But gin no, I ha'e found a cart,O.

John Tamson grew sober, John Tamson ran hame

Skelp, skelping thro' dub an' thro' mire O
He was met at the door by the couthy auld dame,

Wha luggit him straucht tae the byre, O
There his horse stood fu' snug, "Ay puir Bawsie, quo' she

He eat an' drink only his fill, O                    

"Oh quo' Jock, "but he hadna a cronie like me,

Syne "Here's t'ya owre a drap yill O.
