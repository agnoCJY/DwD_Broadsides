PARODY ON THE LAMMY.

O whar hae ye been a' day, creeshie souter Johnnie,
O whar hae ye been a' day, daidling, drucken Johnnie;
"I've been north and I've been south,
Every airt, to tell the truth,
Taking a drap to quench my drouth,
Wi' a neighbour cronie."

And hae ye got it quench'd at last, creeshie souter Johnnie,
And hae ye got it quench'd at last, daidling drucken Johnnie;
Frae morning dawn'd till it was dark,
I've labour'd tightly at the wark,
And yet there's in my throat a spark,
My bonny Annie.

O! look upon your hungry weans, creeshie souter Johnnie,
O! look upon your hungry weans, daidling drucken Johnnie;
See them a' in duddies hingin',
See them a' bare fitted rinnin',
While their shoon ye micht be mennin',
Daidling drucken Johnnie.

O! help me to tak aff my duds, my bonnie lammie,
O! help me to tak aff my duds, my bonnie lammie;
Lay me saftly on the strae,
And keep your wrath till break o' day,
I sair may rue like mony mae,
That e'er ye left your mammie.

BLACK-EYED SUSAN.

All in the Downs the fleet was moor'd,
The streamers waving in the wind,
When black-eyed Susan came on board,
O! where shall I my true love find?
Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true,
If my sweet William sails among your crew?
William, who high upon the yard,
Rock'd with the billows to and fro,
Soon as her well-known voice he heard,
He sigh'd and cast his eyes below;
The cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands,
And quick as lightning on the deck he stands.
So the sweet lark, high poised in air,
Shuts close his pinions to his breast,
If chance his mate's shrill call he hear,
And drops at once into her nest;
The noblest captain in the British fleet,
Might envy William's lips those kisses sweet.

" O Susan, Susan, lovely dear!
My vows shall ever true remain:
Let me kiss off that falling tear,
We only part to meet again:
Change as ye list, ye winds, my heart shall be
The faithful compass that still points to thee.
" Believe not what the landsmen say,
Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind;
They'll tell thee, sailors when away,
In every port a mistress find;
Yes, yes, believe them when they tell thee so,
For thou art present wheresoe'er I go.
" If to far India's coast we sail,
Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright,
Thy breath is Afric's spicy gale,
Thy skin is ivory so white;
Thus every beauteous object that I view,
Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue.

" Though battle calls me from thy arms,
Let not my pretty Susan mourn;
Though cannons roar, yet safe from harms,
William shall to his dear return;
Love turns aside the balls that round me fly,
Lest precious tears should drop from Susan's eye."
The boatswain gave the dreadful word,
The sails their swelling bosoms spread,
No longer must she stay on board;
They kiss'd-she sigh'd-he hung his head;
Her less'ning boat unwilling rows to land,
" Adieu," she cried, and waved her lily hand.
