God speed the keel of the trusty ship
That bears ye from our shore ;
-There is little chance that ye'll ever glance
On our chalky sea beach more.
You are right to seek a far off earth,
You are right to boldly strive
Where Labour does not pine in dearth,
And the honest poor may thrive.
God speed ye all ! ye hopeful band,
O'er your boundless path of blue;
But you'll never forget your own old land
Tho' wealth may gladden the new.

You'll often think of the black-thorn leaves,
And the dog-rose peeping through;
And you'll never forget the harvest sheaves
Tho' the wheat was not for you.
You'll often think of the busy ploughs,
And the merry beating flail;
You'll sometimes dream of the dappled cows,
And the chink of the milking pail.
God speed ye all! ye hopeful band,
With hearts still high and true;
But you'll never forget your own old land
Tho' wealth may gladden the new.

You'll call to mind good neighbour Hind,
And the widow down the lane ;
And you'll wonder if the old man's dead,
Or the widow wed again.
You'll often think of the village spire,
And the churchyard green and fair ;
And perchance you'll sigh, with drooping eye,
If you've left a lov'd one there.
God speed ye all! ye hopeful band,
With hearts still high and true;
But you'll never forget your own old land
Tho' wealth may gladden the new.

Perhaps ye leave a white-haired sire,
A sister, or a brother ;
Perhaps your heart has dared to part
For ever from a mother.
If so, then many a time and oft,
Your better thoughts will roam;
And Mem'ry's pinions, strong and soft,
Will fly to your English home ;
God speed ye all! ye hopeful- band,
O'er your boundless path of blue ;
But you'll never forget your own old land,
Though wealth may gladden the new.
