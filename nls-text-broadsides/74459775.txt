Tune-Original.

When night's dark mantle has covered all

I come in fire arrayed ;
Many a victim I've seen fall,
                  Or  fly from me dismay'd.

Will-o'-the-wisp ! they trembling cry,

Will-o'-the-wisp ! 'tis he !
To mark their fright as off they fly
Is merry sport for me.
CHORUS.

I dance, I dance, I'm here, I'm there,
Who tries to catch me catches but air ;
   The mortal who follows me follows in vain,
For I laugh, ha ! ha ! I laugh, ho ! ho !
I  laugh at their folly and pain.

Many a traveller I deceive,

And with their parting breath
I  hear them call in vain for help,

And dance round them in death.
Will-o'-the-wisp ! they trembling cry,

Will-o'-the wisp ! 'tis he !
To mark their shriek as they sink and die

Is merry sport  for  me.                              

                                               I dance, &c.
