From the delicate nature of the crimes libelled against the prisoners, the evidence
cannot be detailed here, the proceedings being conducted with closed doors; but
after a loug and interesting trial, they were both found Guilty, and, after a solemn
address, were both sentenced to be executed at Edinburgh, on Wednesday the 18th
August next, and their bodies to be given for dissection.
