An ENCOMIASTICK  EPIGRAM

Upon the most  ANTIENT  and   HONOURABLE   TRADE

                                          OF

MASONS.

By Mr. WILLIAM GEDDES, Late Minister at Urquhart.

AMong Mechanicks, MASONS I extoll,
      And with the best I doubt not to Enroll.
  Before the Flood* Antiquity they Claime,			*Antiquity and Noble Precedents.  

  The MASON then must have an antient Name.

  When Godly* Enoch by his Divine Art,				* Josephus de Antiq. Jud. Jude Epist 

        He did foretell how that the World should smart

     By Fire and Water, he two Pillars made,

     The one with Brick, and one with Stone was laid :

     He wrote thereon all Sciences and Arts,

     Some knowledge to Diffuse in  all Mens hearts.

     If Water came, the Stone might it endure ;

     The Brick the Fire ; so all continued sure.

     The*  Moral-Law, in writ none could it have,		* EXOD. 32.  

   Till GOD Himself in Stone he must it Grave.

 For Hewing Stone, none can put you to shame,

 The Corner-Stone, to JESUS  is a Name :			Honorable and mysterious Badge. 
  For this I think the MASON must be Blest,

From antient times he hath a Divine*  Crest. 			*A Metaphore taken from a part of the coat of Arms.
A Character whereby they know each other,
And yet so Secret, none knows but a Brother.

All Temples,  Turrets,*   Pallaces  of  Kings,			* Noble  and  Stately Works
All Castles, Steeples, aud such other things :
Strong Holds and Houses, which do long endure,
Do owe all what they have to MASONS CURE.
All Courts great Grandeur, and Magnifick State,
What Pomp they have, from MASONS they doget  ;

The strictest Laws  they  have for* Common-well,		*Law and order. 
The greatest Charity when BRETHREN  fail,

Symbols Divine, *Pomp, Dwelling, Law and Love ;			*The sum of all
Few are the Men who  do such Tradsmen  prove.
