The Slippy Stane

NANCY  WHISKY.      THE NAMELESS LASSIE.
THE SCOTCH BRIGADE   SOMEWHERE THE SUN Is SHINING

The Slippy Stane.

Wade canny through this weary  world,
An'  pick your  steps  wi'   care ;
Never wi' your neebours quarrel,
But aye dae what is fair.
Folks fa' an' never rise again,
Wha never fell  before,         
For there's aye a muckle slippy stane
At ilka body's door.

Gin your neebour chance to slip,
Ye mauny  pass him by,
But len' a han', help him up,
Dinna lat him lie
The case may sometimes be your ain,
Tho' ye hae walth in stone 
For there's aye a muckle slippy stane
At ilka body's door.



There's slippy stanes where'er ye gang,
At palace, cot, or ha',
An' ye maun watch an' no' gang wrang,
Or ower them ye may fa'.
For emperors and kings hae fa'en,
An'  nobles mony a score;
 For there's aye a muckle slippy stane
At  ilke body's door.

The Scotch Brigade.

On the banks of the Clyde stood a lad and his lassie,
The lad's name was Geordie, the lassie's was Jean.
She flung her arms around him, and cried do not leave me,
For Geordie as going to fight for his Queen.
She gave him a lock of her bright golden, tresses,
She kiss'-d him, and prese'd him once more to her heart,
Till his eyes spoke of the love which his lips could not utter,
But the last words are spoken, they kiss, and, they part.

CHORUS—

Over the burning plains of Egypt,
Under the scorching sun,
He thought of the stories he'd have to tell
His love when the fight, was done.
He treasured with care  that dear lock of hair,
For his own darling Jeannie he prayed;
But his prayer was in vain, for she'll ne'er see again
Her lad in the Scotch Brigade.

Tho' an ocean divided the lad from his lassie,
Tho' Geordie was forced far away o'er the foam,
His roof was the sky, and his bed was the desert,
But his heart with his Jeannie was always at home.
The morning that, dawned on the day of battle,
Found, Geordie enacting a true hero's part,
Till an enemy's bullet brought with it its 'billet,
And buried that dear lock of hair in his heart.

On the banks of the Clyde dwells a heart broken mother,
For the sake of the laddie who died far away.
But Jeannie is with her to comfort and shield her,
Together they weep and together they pray,
But the glory of England to her brought no comfort,
They told her of how the great victory was won,
And Jeannie her daughter will be while she lives,
For glory to her meant the loss of her son.

Somewhere the Sun is Shining.

Somewhere in the world the moon  is shining,
Shining on the fields and golden hills;
Somewhere near the shadows slowly falling,
Creeping o'er the silent vales and rills.
Oftimes I find my heart is longing
Just to press her dear sweet lips to mine—
Caress her with burning love and kisses;
Yet I wonder will there come a time.

                 

                 REFRAIN-



Somewhere the sun is shining,
Somewhere a little rain ;
Somewhere a heart is pining
For love, but all in vain.
Somewhere a soul is drifting
Further and further apart;
Somewhere my love lies dreaming.
Somewhere a broken heart.

If in years to come she should recall me,
Would she love me and still hold me dear?
Would she then forget  those cruel words spoken
When my jealous rage caused her to fear?
Oftimes I think she knows I'm longing,
Knows that she could ease my  aching heart,
Would she say, "Forgive me, oh, my darling;
Do not grieve, for we shall never part."
REFRAIN-

Nancy Whisky.

This very old song can only be had in the
Poet's Box, price One Penny.
Air—It's very Strange.

This seven long years  I've been a weaver,
Until my wages they were pulled down,
And, to buy myself a new suit of clothes,
I  took my way up to Dublin town.
As I was walking up Dublin city,
Nancy Whisky I chanced to smell,
I thought it proper to call in and see her—
For seven years I had loved her well.

As I walked in unto the parlour,
And asked pardon for making free—
Your pardon's granted, kind sir, she answered,
You're welcome to me sweet Jack M'Gee.
I sat down all by the table,
And valued each other there for a while;
The more I tasted the more I loved her,
Till Nancy's charms they did me beguile.

 'T'was very early in the morning,
Finding myself in a strange bed,
I went to rise, but I was not able,
For Nancy's charms they held down my head.
I called the landlady to the parlour,
And asked her what was to pay—
Thirty shillings, it is the reckoning,
So pay me quickly and go away.

It's I pulled out a purse with money,
And to her the reckoning I did pay down;
I paid to her her thirty shillings,
And all that remained was a bare half crown.
As I was walking up Dublin city,
Nancy's sister I chanced to spy;
And with 'her I spent two and twopence,
And all that remained was the crooked boy.

As I stepped in unto the parlour,
I left that surplus all with the rest;
Here's a health to all clever fellows,
And to the fair one I love best.
I'll go  home, and I'll join my weaving,
And I'll throw my shuttle another while;
And if I live to another season,
Nancy's charms won't me beguile.

The Nameless Lassie.

There's  nane may ever guess guess or trow my bonnie lassie'name,
 There's name may ken the humble cot my lassie ca's her hame,
Yet though my lassie's nameless, an' her kin o' low degree,
Her heart is warm, her thoughts are pure, an' O, she's dear
to me.



She's gentle as she's  bonnie, an' she's, modest  as she's fair;
Her virtues, like her beauties a' , are varied; as they're rare—
While she is light and merry as the lammie on the lea,
For happiness an' innocence thegither aye maun be.

When she unveils her blooming face, the flowers may cease 
to blaw.

An' when she ope's her hinnied lips, the air it trembles a';
But when wi ithers sorrow touched the tear stands in, her e'e,
Oh, that's the gem in beauty's crown the priceless pearl to me.
Within my soul her form's enshrined, her heart is a' my ain,
An' richer prize, or purer bliss, nae mortal e'er can gain—
The darkest paths o' life I tread wi' steps o' bounding glee,
Cheer'd onward by the love that  lights my nameless lassie's

Copies can always be' had at, the Poet's Box, Overgate, Dundee.
