THE IRISH GIRL.

As I walked out one evening down by the river side,
I gazed around me and an Irish girl I spied,
So red and rosy were her cheeks, and yellow was her hair,
And costly were the robes of gold this Irish girl did wear.

Her shoes were of the Spanish black and spangled round
with dew,
She wrung her hands and tore her hair, crying what shall I do
I'm going home, I'm going home, I'm going home said she,
you go.a roving and slight your Polly.

The very  ast time that I saw my love, he was very bad.
The only lequest he asked was for to tie his head.
There's mrny a man is worse than he,  then why should 1
compaain,
O  love it Us a killing thing; did you ever feel the pain ?

I  wish my love was a red rose bud and in that garden there,
And I to be the gardener, of her I would take care,
There is not a month in all the year but my love I'd renew,
With lillies 1 would garnish her, sweet William, thyme, and
And Rue.

I wish I was a butterfly, I'd fly to my love's breast,
Or was I but a linnet, I'd sing my love to rest,
Or was I a nightingale I'd singto the morning clear,
I'd sit and sing for Polly, my jo  and only dear

I wish I was in Manchester, sitting en the grass,
With a pint of wine in my hand, and on my knee a lase,
We'd call for liquor merrily. and pay before we go,
I would roll her in my arms let the wind blow high or low.
