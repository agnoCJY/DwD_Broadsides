The Whigs and Radicals !

Composed by John M'Lean, Coal-miner, and
Poet Laureate to his Baccanalian Majesty.

Come voters now, come every one,
Vote for Campbell as fast's you can ;
Don't let a Tory into the chair,
For he'll lead you into a snare.

Campbell is coming, hurrah ! hurrah !
Campbell is coining, hurrah ! hurrah !
Aytoun is coming, the Tories are running,
And Campbell is coming, hurrah, hurrah.

Vote for Aytoun as quick as you can,
He's fit enough for a Parliament-man,
Dress him up with the laurels so green,
He's the boy that'll surely dazzel their een.

Aytoun he lives in Heriot Raw,
He swears that he will beat them a';
He's a good man, as I understand,
He wants free trade throughout the land.

Coachman Jack, will beat a retreat,
When the Whigs and Tories meet,
For the Whigs they are too strong,
So Tory Jack he wont stand long.

Look at the nation how its distress'd,
And the poor how sorely press'd;
The want of money makes many one sad,
Which shows the times are very bad.

The Tories now they all agree
To kick out the Whigs where'er they be;
I would rather see the trade to mend,
Than bother my head a member to send.

Come fill up a bumper and let it go round,
And drink success to the King and Crown,
Success to the Whigs and Aytoun also,
Down with the Tories to the regions below.
