THE

OLD ARM CHAIR

I love it, I love it, and who shall dare
To chide me for loving that old arm chair :
I've treasured it long as a noble prize,
I've bedewed it with tears, and embalmed it with sighs
'Tis bound by a thousand bands to my heart;
not a tie will break nor a link will start;
Would he learn the spell ? a mother sat there,
And a sacred thing is that old arm chair.

I sat and watched her many a day,
When her eye grew dim and her locks were gray;
And I almost blessed her when she smiled
And turned from her bible to bless her child ;
years rolled on, but the last one sped,
My idol was shattered, my earth star fled,
I learned how much the heart can bear,
When I saw her die in that old arm chair.

'Tis past !  'tis past, but I gaze on it now
With quivering breath and throbbing brow ;
'Twas there she nursed me, 'twas there she died.
And memory flows with lava tide ;
Say it is folly and deem me weak,
While the scalding tears started down my cheek;
But I love it, I love it, and cannot tear
My soul from loving that old arm chair.
