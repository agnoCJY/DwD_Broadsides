THE MOUND'S APPEAL. 

SCOTCHMEN ! in Auld reekie born,
You, who fools and tyrants scorn,
Welcome, this bright April morn,
	To do the needful here !

Think of me - your father's pride -
See the gashes in my side,
While you can neither walk nor ride
	So well as heretofore.

For three score years my body grew,
Bigger and bigger - all for you ;
But now foul play does me undo,
	And you are yet content.

O ! surely you'll be mov'd in time
To lift the stanes frae aff my wyme,
And let me rise to glorious prime,
	To do my best for you.

Three useful roads can I uphold,
With much that cannot now be told ;
And all if you are only bold
	To lift your voice and say -

" The Mound's our own, and so 's the cash
" That made this ugly, murderous gash ;
" Are we no better than mere trash
	" In sight of silly fools ?

" Shall Scotland's thistle be put down,
" And by a primrose be outgrown ?
" Shall we hold nothing of our own,
	" And, bootless, leave the field ?

" It cannot - must not - shall not be !
" O ! let us all in this agree,
" Nor to the devil pay a fee
	" For doing so much harm."
