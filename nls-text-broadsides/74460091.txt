BY ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH

Rumoured Death
OF  THE

DUKE
OF
WELLINGTON.

FROM THE WITNESS.

Edinburgh, Wednesday. Sept.15, 1852.

At an early hour yesterday evening the
following intelligence reached town by elec-
tric telegraph, taken from a sixth edition
of the Sun :-

" His Grace the Duke of Wellington ex-
pired at half-past three this (Tuesday) after-
noon at Walmer-Castle."

At a later hour (half-past twelve) the
following also reached us by electric tele-
graph :-

" The Standard says that the news reach-
ed Apsley House by a private message of
the telegraph of the South Eastern Railway.''

But this apparent confirmation of the ru-
mour is accompanied  by the following, which
leads us to infer that the rumour is at least
premature :-

" LONDON, 10.30 P.M-In reply to en-
quiries made at Apsley House at ten o'clock,
it was stated that no news had been received
from Walmer Castle ; and a similar answer
was given at the Horse Guards and Buck-
ingham Palace."

As no public announcement had previous-
ly been made of his Grace's indisposition,
the probability is that the rumour is without
foundation.

Should any authentic intelligence on the
subject reach us in course of the day, we
will announce it in a second edition.
