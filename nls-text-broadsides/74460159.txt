ON

the Death of his Grace

JOHN 
DUKE OF 
ROTHES
LORD High CHANCELLOUR of

SCOTLAND, &c.

                            E   L   E   G  I  E.

I S R A E L  for Moses fourty days did Mourn,
Our Joy to Grief twice fourty days may turn ;
Scotlands Conductor, R 0 T H E S, Wise and Brave,
A h! now Himself Conducted is to Grave :                               

ROTHES did Rule our Helm in Storms, and Grace
The Halcyon Calmness of our Oceans Peace:
Dread Comet, ah ! too dreadful not in vain.
Fatal to Albions Pole, and Charles Wain ;
judicious DUKE , able to quench all Jarrs,
On which may risc Uncivil, Civil Warrs,
Most prudent States-man, Sage to Reconceal,
Knowing thy Kings Will, was the Kingdoms Well ;
In Court, in Camp, in City, Field, or Town ;
Worthy to bear a Batton or a Gown.

No Fate could make thy Loyalty relent:
Nor Bondage of thy long Imprisonment ;
Give Thou then Griev'd , it was that then the while
Thou could not Serve thy Master in Exyle;
Yet there Thy Thoughts, and Corrospondence too,
Acted the most a Prisoner could do ;
Vet never Winter made of Summer, more
Joyful to Thee ,   when Heavens did Him Restore:
And made Thy Self after a long Restraint :
A Vig'rous, and most Active Instrument, 
For which, Thou didst Thy Monarchs Love Inherit,
The due Reward of Thy Desert and Merit ;
A Love most Firm, arid Great, to be Admir'd,
But Chang'd to Sorrow, since Thy Breath expyr'd.

Great DUKE, Lord Chancellour, Gen'ral, Thesanrcr,
His Majesties most High Commissioner.

What Greatness could Thou Want,Thy King could Give,           
Who only in Thy Destiny did Grieve ;                                      

He Could not also give Thee long to Live.                              

Yet, since Heavens Doom, no Flesh from Death reprives;
Thou'rt Mourn'd by Scotlands Representatives.
Thy Death makes York, our Hign Commissioner Sad :
He, even more High, then ere our Nation had.
 To Pen Thy Praise, exceeds all Poets Skill ;
And does require Apollo's Choisest Quill ;
Sure than Thy Name great Honour does obtain,
To whom the Highest Praises are but Mean.
Then Blest are You Calestial Minds that move;
unceffantly the Spacious Orbs Above ;

For if Your Toyl prove Irksome, You may Rest,

And Trust Your work to this New Heavenly Guest.             M. M.
