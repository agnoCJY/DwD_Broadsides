Box, 

Air Original.



I am a simple muleteer, not too particular to rules,

I treat the world, both far and near,

As roughly as I treat my mules, as I treat my mules,

If they attempt to give me laws, without, without good cause,

Or when I bid them, do not start, Clic clac, my course is

clear,
Drop that, my lads, or else you'll smart, Clic clac, my course

is clear,

Clic clac, my course is clear, my way is clear,
Clic clac, my way is clear, I am a Muleteer.

Yes, faith I am a Muleteer, far known and thro' Castille

renowned,

And many a loving breast when near,
Doth tremble 'neath its corsage bound, 'neath its corsage

bound;

And should one call, I fly to aid, I fly to aid,
To help the fair I'm ne'er afraid, no, no, I'm ne'er afraid.
Against any odds I take their part, Clic clac, my trade is

clear,

Clic clac, my trade is clear, Clic clac, my trade is clear,
Clic clac, my trade is clear, I am a Muleteer.
