Ye Needna be

Courtin' at Me,

Auld Man.

Oh, ye needna be courtin at me, auld man,

Ye needna be courtin' at me; 

Ye're threescore and three, and ye're blin' o' an e'e
Sae ye needna be courtin' at me, auld man,
Ye needna be courtin' at me.

Hae patience, and hear me a wee, sweet lass,

Hae patience, and hear me a wee,
I hae gowpins o' gowd, and an awmry weel stow'd
And a heart that Io'es nane but thee, sweet lass,
And a heart that lo'es nane but thee.

Gang hame to your gowd and your gear, auld man
Gang hame to your gowd and your gearâ€”
There's a laddie I ken has a heart like my ain,

And to me he shall ever be dear, auld man,

And to me he shall ever be dear.

I'll busk ye as braw as a queen, sweet lass,

I'll busk ye as braw as a queen ;

I hae guineas to spare, and, hark ye, what's mair,

I'm only twa score and fifteen, sweet lass, 

I'm only twa score and fifteen.

Oh, stan' aff na, and fash me nae mair, auld man,

Stan' aff na, and fash me nae mair,

There's something in love that your gowd canna

I'll be Johnnie's although I gang bare, auld man,
I'll be Johnnie's although I gang bare,
