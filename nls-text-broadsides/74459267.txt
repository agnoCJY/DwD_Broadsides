TUNE.-Original.

O, there ance liv'd a chap and they ca'd him Jock.
For mony a lang year he liv'd wi' his mother,
And by her it's he was adored like a king ,
For he had neither sister nor brother.

CHORUS----

Right tooral looral, tooral looral, rant a rooral lay,

When Jock turned big, and big wages did mak',
Says he, " I've got tired of brose and butter,
So I'll  tak' naething at nichts noo, when I come hame,
Except that ye aye bring tripe to my supper."

So his mither obeyed and she bought him tripe,
And she took a plan when he stopp'd out late;
She laid the can on the end o' the mangle
And Jock ate his tripe in the dark and this saved candle.

Rut Jock ae day to a wedding had gane,
His mither, that nicht, she tripe bought nane ;
" There will be something gaun there stronger than water,
And Jock, he'll no can tak' ony supper."

So away she went her lace mutch to wash,
And wi' black sape and soda, for tae steam it white ;
Wi' loo-warm water she mixed up a splatter,
And put it into the can where she kept Jock's tripe.

Jock he cam' hame between e'en and morn,
Wi' a guid drap o' barley bree in his horn ;
"I ha'e turned sick, I have ta'en sae much drink,
But I'll be better if I had my tripe, I think."

Jock grapes round in the dark, and he was glad,
He cries,'"here is the can and tripe in't tae;"
Jock lifts up the can, tak's all the lid,
Claps it to his month and drinks up the brae.

Jock twisted his mouth maist frae lug to lug,
Cries, " sic brae I never tasted such !"
He laid down the can where he took it frae,
And he put in his hand and he pu'd out the mutch.

Jock took his chaft-teeth and he chew'd it weel,
And wi' the front anes gaid round and round ;
He tore the border richt frae the crown,
Jock's thrapple being wide, the mutch gaed down.

His mither got up at the break o' day
For to bleach her mutch on the green,
And aff to the can she gaed straightway,
But neither brae nor mutch could be seen.

Jock gi'es a roar, and be cries, " I'm dead !
All ! there's something here like a. lump o' lead ;"
His mither she aff for the Doctor ran,
When she saw Jock gape like a half-choked swan.

When the Doctor came he felt Jock's pulse,
And without delay he ordered a vomit ;
But he stared, and he laughed till he maistly burst,
When he saw a laced mutch come out o' Jock's stomach.

Says the Doctor, " I have been on India's shores,
And I have seen vomits baith black and yellow ;
But this I never did see before.
A lace mutch on the stomach of any fellow."

Twa or three days after this, Jock got better,
But he, couldna, refrain frae drinking cauld water ;
Jock said,  " should he live to the age that he would need a
crutch,
That he hoped be again would ne'er snap up a mutch."
