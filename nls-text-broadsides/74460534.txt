WILLIAM CALCRAFT, the general executioner of
Great Britain and who officiated at Dumbarton on the
18th Jan 1861, was born in theyear 1801, of humble
but industrious parents, in a little village about ten miles
from London, situated in the county of Essex. When 19
years of age he was appointed to the office of Newgate
Hangman, and on being installed swore to the following
oath—" I'swear to hang or belad, and  to draw and
quarter, or otherwise destroy all felons and enemies to
the peace of our Lord the King, and of his subjects, duly
sentenced according to law; and I will do the like unto
father or mother, sister or brother, and all other kindred   
whatsoever, without favour or hindrance. So help me
God.

Thereupon a black veil is throw over him at his rising.,
when he is conducted out of the court, amid the groaning
of the assemblage. the tolling of the death-bell, and the
horrifying words of the city jude grating in his ears,
"Get thee hence, wretch!"

The hall in which the oath is ministered contains a
table with the following article placed thereon:—An
axe well sharpened I-the same at that used for the be-
heading of traitors- a pair of leg-irons-handcuffs and 
other fetters-a small coil of rope-a pair of white caps.

THE ENGLISH CRIMINAL CODE.

In the reign of   Henry VIII., according  to sharon
Turner, there were executed 72,000 great and petty
thieves. According to Hume 2000 were executed annu-
ally during that reign for theft and robbery only. Besides
other criminals. In the century from 1638 to 1738, there
were 70,000 executions, or 700 per annum. From 1820
to 1824, the first inclusive and the last exclusive, there 
were 290 or 93 a year.   From 1828 to1831, there were
230, ot 57 ½ a year. From 1832 to 1835, there were 155,
or 38 ¾ a year;  but in the year 1836 there were only 17
executions.                                       

The Plantagenets made 4 offences capital
TheTudors                 27          —
The Stuarts                 35           —
The Hanoverians         156          —

Which were reduced in number considerably in the reign
of George IV and William IV., and in the reign of her
present Majesty, so great has heen the santoration of our
Criminal Code, that there are now only nine offences
punishable with death.

For the origin of this purification of our statute Book
from blood  we are mainly indebted to the late Sir Samuel
Rowiney and the late Mr. Whitbread.
