A Second Defence

OF

The Scotish Vision.

HOW stronge's thy Sense ! How charming are thy Strains !

      Who by soft Numbers moves our Northern Swains:

In gently Treating, with mild Words, a Peer,

Whom for unbyass'd Truth we all admire.

But thou so gen'rously dost treat the Scotch,

Ev'n to commend them for their Lice arid Botch.

It seems not strange that thou art turn'd so bold

Thy Malice 'gainst their Peers now to unfold.

His Cicervman Stile may well compare

With all the Smoothness of thy British Air;

And his strong Sense in the presaging Vision,

Make Wife Men have thy Pamphlet in Derision.

Tis strange thy Gen'rous Courtship to their Peers

Put's not thy brain-sick Head in Pannick Fears,

Whilst thou'rt so bold in Verse to make us know

That to us and our Peers thou art DE FOE.

Such grateful Things thou of our Country tells,

As that you think none your base Treach'ry smells:

You in each Company are pleas'd to cant,

Tis here to Live, and here to Dwell, you want.

What Change is this ! to Live 'mongst Lice and Scabs

And to be serv'd by nastie filthy Drabs.

But in old England thou art not secure

For which the Noisome Vermine you endure.

Thou to thy Native Country art unkind,

And the Brave Scots thou never did befriend.

May thou to ev'ry Country Treach'rous be

And they prove Mortal Enemies to thee:

No Fun'ral Honours unto thee be given

A Friend to Hell an Enemie to Heaven.
