THE SONS OF ALBION.

AIRâ€”" Britain's sons never were afraid."
Ye sons of Albion bind up your
arms,
To quell the rebel band,
Who threaten us with false alarms,
To invade our native land ;
For there's no rebel Frenchman
sans galore,
Lords, Dukes of the tyrants of
yore,
Can conquer the English, the Irish
or Scotch,
Or land upon our shore.
Can conquer the English, the Irish
or Scotch,
Or land upon our shore.

Deceitful Holland fears our yoke,
And so does faithless Spain ;
But we, the British hearts of oak,
Will beat them back again.
The Emperor of the universe,
Bonaparte, he fain would be;
But we, the British hearts of oak,
Will keep old England free.

But we the British hearts of oak,
Will keep old England free.
