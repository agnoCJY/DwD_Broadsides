A NEW 
SONG.

Sin' my uncle's dead I've lads anew,
Wha ne'er cam' here before to woo ;
But to the laddie I'll prove true,
that lo'ed me first o'ony O.

I've lads anew sin' I got gear,
Wha scarce before my price would spier,
But nane to me is ha'f so dear,
as my true lover Johnny O.

Weel do I mind on auld lang syne,
when they did laugh at me and mine ;
But I'll pay them back in their ain coin,
and show them I lo'e Johnny O.

I'll ne'er forget my youthfu' days,
Where aftentimes I've gather'd slaes,
And row'd upon yon Craikgen braes
Wi' the pride o'Caledonia.

The laird cam o'er and tell'd my dad,
that surely I was turnin' mad ;
He tell'd my mam I lo'ed a lad,
that was neither rich nor bonny O.

The Laird he's but a senseless cock ;
Altho' my laddie has nae stock
He is the flower o' a' the flock,
and the pride o' Caledonia.

When I wrought to the laird for fee,
He would neither look nor speak to me ;
But now at breakfast, dine and tea,
he would fain mak' me his croney O.

But as sure as gowd cures the heart ake,
'Tis only for my siller's sake
/ill/  the mair o' me that he does make,
the mair I lo'e my Johnny O.

But now the weddin' day is set,
when I'll be married to my pet ;
How pleasantly I'll pay the debt,
I'm awn sae long to Johnny O.

Now fiddlers a' cast aff your coats,
And gi'es a reel upon the spot ;
Play Jockie's made a weddin' o't
I've pledg'd my cockermony O.

Now laddies ha'd your lassies till't
and lasses a' your coaties kilt ;
Come let us ha'e some canty lilt,
Sin' I ha'e got my Johnny O.

I've got my heart's desire at last,
Tho' many a frown's between us past ;
But sin' we're tied baith firm and fast,
may peace crown Caledonia.
