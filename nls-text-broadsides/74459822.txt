SCOTS, wha hae wi' Wallace bled-
 Scots, wham Bruce has aften led—
Welcome to your gory bed,

Or to victorie !

Now's the day, and now's the hour !
See the front of battle lour !
See approach poor Edward's pow'r !

Wha will be a traitor knave ?
Wha can fill a coward's grave?
Wha sae base as be a slave ?

Traitor ! turn and flee !
Wha for Scotland's king and law!
Freedom's sword will strongly draw !
Freeman stand, or freeman fa'—

Let him on wi' me !

By your sons in servile chains !
We will drain our dearest veins,

But they shall be free'
Lay the proud usurpers low
Tyrants fall in ev'ry foc
Liberty's in ev'ry blow !

Let us do, or de' !

Ah ! Selima, how cruel you prove,
Yet sure my hard lot you'll bewail ,

I should  not  presume you would love,
Yet pity I hop'd would prevail.

And has she, &c.

And since hatred alone I inspire

Life henceforth is not worth  my case

Death now is my only desire,
I give myself up to despair.
And as s.
