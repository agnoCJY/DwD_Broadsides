THERE'S A CORNER
FOR YOU AT MY
FIRESIDE STILL
PRICE ONE PENNY.

One day while walking down the   street, an old   pal I
did meet,
I scarcely would have known him, for he looked so ill
and weak,
And as he grasped me by the hand, these words to me
he said-
Dear  Jim, I don't  know   what  to do, for   all I loved
are dead.
I told him to keep up his heart, and as I turned away,
A shilling I placed into his hand, and  these words   to
him did sayâ€”

CHORUS.

Come in the morning, come at night
Come in the eve when the moon shines bright.
Come at noontide, come when you will,
There's a corner for yon at my fireside ssill,

How oft we meet a young man, wreck'd on the sea of 
life,
Who'd done his best to keep afloat, and avoid all care
and strife;
Been wreck'd upon life's hidden rocks, and all his bright
hopes fled,
How oft he's whisper'd to himself, I wish that I were
dead ;
Let's try and lend a helping hand, when we find a firend
like that,
And whisper this into his car, 'twill eheer his   sinking
heart--Chorus.

Now, sad's the loss of life that's been, around our coast
of late,
And many a widow now does mourn her husband's crul
fate;
We should try and do the best we can to help them in
their plight,
I don't think that Dundoe will be the last to give   her
mite.
To help those helpless orphents let's   show a   Christian
will.
And find a corner for them at our fireside still.                                                                      Chorus-
