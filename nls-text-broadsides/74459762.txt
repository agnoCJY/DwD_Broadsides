And Peggy is dear to Johnnie,
And none in all Scot' and here or there

And Peggy has vow'd their love to crown
O whistle my love and I'll come down,
And gang to the kirk with Johnny,

And Peggy can play so sprightly,
And when in the dance she moves her
There's none can trip it so lightly (feet

O whistle my love and I'll come  down,
And hie to the kirk with Johnny,

And Peggy has nought of riches,

That everv eye bewitches,     (crown,

And  Peggy has  vowed their loves  to

O whistle my love and I'll come down
And hie to the kirk with  Johnny.
