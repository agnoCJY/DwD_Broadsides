TOBY  BRAD    

OR, FUNKING THE COBBLER.

SWEET   ROSE OF YARROW

There once was a cobbler by name
Toby Brad,
Though he lived in a stall yet he
didn't live bad,
with a tol de rol lol, &c.   
One night he was mending an old
pair of shoes,
And helooked very black as if he'd
got the blues,
For it happen'd to be the next
day after Sunday,
And snobs, you  all know don't
like working on Monday.
with their fol, &c.

Now the leather was tough, and
the awl wouldn't pierce,
which made Toby Brad look devil-
ish fierce,
with his fol, & c.
He took up his lapstone, & ham-
mer'd it out.
Then he hammer'd his fingers and
that made him shout—
As he threw down the work with
passion well cramm'd,
Crying out 'You may go to Old
Nick and be ——,
with his fol, &c.

In this   shocking manner he'd  no
sooner swore,
Than a thundering knocking was
heard at the door,
With a fol, &c.
He shivered and shook from his
head to his feet,
He was all in a tremble and white
as a sheet,
For he very well knew and that
made him feel queer,
If you talk of the Devil he is sure
to appear.
With his fol, &c.

Now Toby had read in the Tales
of the Ghostes,
Now devils in smoke rise behind
you bedpostes,
with his fol, &c.
As he was thinking a cloud then
arose.
And the smoke it all got up the
cobbler's nose,
And he said to himself, though a-
fraid to be joking,
If this is the devil, I'll swear he's
been smoking.
With a fol, &c

Then he shivered and quivered
and fell on his knees,
Crying out,' Mr. Nick, go away,
if you please,
With your fol, &c.
He took out his bible, which alway s
was by him,
He thought while he'd that, that
Old  Nick daren't   come
nigh him,
Then eagerly over his shoulder he
stares,
Then he bobbed back his   head,
and got saying his prayers
With a fol,&c.

I never yet harmed child, woman,
or man,
I haven't got drunk since teetotal-
ing began,
With a fol, &c.
I ne'er stole a penny from any
man's purse,
I ne'er cut a throat, tho' I might
have done worse,
I ne'er told a lie in the whole of
my life,
Nor  I never seduced any other
mans wife.
With a fol, &c.

Then the cobbler began to confess
all his sins,
Then he made an endeavour to
stand on his pins,
with my fol, &c,
And when by degrees he at length
stood upright,
He was just like a ghost,so dread-
fully white.
That he  tried hard to look, tho' he
did it with pain,
When a voice cried, 'Hollo !' and
he went down  again.
with his fol, &c.

Now as he  lay   on  the ground
nearly dead,
A thought very suddenly came in
his head,
with his fol &c.
He took  up  his hammer which
was by his side,
Which over his  shoulder at Old
Nick he shied
But as no Nick was there, the un-
fortunate ass,
Only    sent   the  great   hammet
throgh six squares of glass
with a fol, &c.

Now Toby   jumped   up nearly
frightened to death,
And cut out of his stall, ne'er stop-
ing for breath,
with a fol, &c.
He oft looked behind, to see if be
was follow'd,
Some charity boys then arter him
halloed
He'd   heard 'em before,  and he
knew by their shout,
It was  only  them beggars   been
funking him out.
With his fol, &c.


SWEET ROSE of YARROW

THE morning broke in blushes
e'er me.
As up the sunny hills I stray'd
A beautious form appeared before
me,
When thus I spoke the lovely
maid.
Sweet maid, ah, wither dost thou
roam ?
Thine eye is cupid's piercing
arrow;
Thy name—ah, prythee, tell me,
love !
She said, they call me Rose at
Yarrow.

Be mine, sweet maid, and fond I'll
cherish,
Those blooming charms   have
won my heart,
And  sooner,   dearest,   would  I
perish,
Than one pang to thes impart.
She blush'd con ented, the village
peel,                       (morrow,
Rang for our nuptials on the
And blest for ever do I feel,
Possess'd of thee,  sweet Rose
of Yarrow.
