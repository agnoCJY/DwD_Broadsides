YE MARINERS OF

ENGLAND.

Ye mariners of England!
Who guard our native seas
Whose flag has braved, a thousand years,
The battle and the breeze!
Your glorious standard launch again,
To match another foe!
And sweep through the deep,
While the stormy tempests blow;
While the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy tempests blow.

The spirits of your fathers
Shall start from every wave!
For the deck it was a field of fame,
And ocean was their grave;
Where Blake and mighty Nelson fell,
Your manly hearts shall glow;
As you sweep through the deep,
While the stormy tempests blow:
While the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy tempests blow,

Britannia needs no bulwarks,
No towers along the steep;
Her march is o'er the mountain-waves,
Her home is on the deep,
With thunders from her native oak
She quells the floods belowâ€”
As they roar on the shore,
When the stormy tempests blow:
When the battle rages loud and long,
And the stormy tempests blow.

The meteor flag of England
Shall yet terrific burn;
Till danger's troubled night depart,
And the star of peace return,
Than, then, ye ocean-warriors!
Our song and feast shall flow
To the fame of your name,
When the storm has ceased to blow;
When the fiery fight is heard no more,
And the storm has ceased to blow.
