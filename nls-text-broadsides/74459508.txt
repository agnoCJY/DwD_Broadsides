An excellent new Play-House Song;
called, the bonny Gray-ey'd
Morn;
OR,
Jockie  rouz'd with Love.

To an excellent new Tune.

The bonny Gray-ey'd Morn began for to peep
when Jockie rouz'd with Love came blithly on;
And I who wishing lay depriv'd of sleep, 
abhor'd the lazy Hours that flow did run.
But meikle were my Joy's when in my View
I from the Window spy'd my only Dear ;
I took the Wings of Love and to him flew,
for I had fancy'd all my Heaven was there.

Upon my Bosom Jockie laid his Head,
and sighing told me pretty Tales of Love
My yielding Heart, at every Word he said,
did flutter up and down,and strangely move;
He sighing, kiss'd my hand,and vow'd and swore,
that I had o'er his Heart a Conquest gain'd.
Then blushing begg'd,that I would grant him more
which he alas! too soon, too soon obtain'd. 

Nor that I do repent, I did comply;
but this I needs must own, my yielding Heart
Was quickly overcome by Jockie's Eye,
which gave a deeper wound than Cupids dart,
His Cheeks were Cherry red, his Lips the same,
his Tongue so many Charms could still express:
That every word he said did raise new Flames,
and kindled, kindled Fire in my Breast.


My Jockie does a thousand ways beside,
express himself in tender Love to me:
With Arms about my waste, he sighing cry'd,
oh give me thy Consent or I must die,
Then with a gentle Kiss doth beg again,
that his poor wounded Heart I would but cure,
Nor thinking that I felt his Love-sick Pain,
for alas! 'twas his, 'twas his before.

And now! I could no longer hide my Pain,
but let my dearest Jockie know my Heart.   
Oh, how he hugg'd me in his Arms again!
and ev'ry Kiss he gave did ease my Smart ;
Then vowing o'er and o'er betwixt each Kiss,
he constant would remain while Life did last ;
Now tell me Lovers; where's the Hurt of this,
for to enjoy, when that the Knot's ty'd fast?

FINIS.
