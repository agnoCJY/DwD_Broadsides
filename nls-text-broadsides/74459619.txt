The Low-Backed   Car.

PrICe ONE PENNy.

Copies of this  popular song  can always be had

Tuneâ€”Original.

When first I saw sweet Peggy,
'Twas on a market day
A low-backed car she drove, and sat
Upon a truss of hay!
But when that hay was blooming grass,
And decked with flowers of spring.
No flower was there that could compare
With the blooming girl I sing,
As she sat in the low-backed car,
The man at the turnpike bar,
Never asked for the toll
But just rubbed his old poll,
And looked after the low-backed car.

In battle's wild commotion,
The proud and mighty Mars,
With hostile scythes demands the tithe,
Of death, in warlike cars.
While Peggy, peaceful goddess
Has darts in her bright eye,
That knock men down in the market town
As right and left they fly,
While she sits in her low-backed car,
Than battle more dangerous far,
For the doctor's art
Cannot cure the heart,
That is hit from the low-backed car.

Sweet Peggy round her car, sir,
Has strings of ducks and geese,
But the scores of hearts she slaughter
By far outnumber these.
While she among her poultry sits,
Just like a turtle-dove,
Well worth the cage I do engage,
Of the blooming God of love.
While she sits in the low-backed car,
The lovers come near and far,
And envy the chicken
That Peggy is picking,
As she sits in the low-backed car,

Oh ! I'd rather own that car, sir,
With Peggy by my side,
Than a coach and four, and gold galore,
And a lady for my bride.
For the lady would sit forninst me,
On a cushion made with taste,
While Peggy would sit beside me,
With my arm around her waist.
While we drove in the low-backed car
To be married by Father Mahar,
Oh ! my heart would beat high
At her glance and her sigh,
Though it beat in a low backed  car.
