PRICE ONE PENNY

This Popular Song can always be had at the Poet's Fox
182 OVERGATE. DUNDEE.

Tis but a little faded flower,

But oh, how fondly dear,
'Twill bring me back one golden hour,

Through many, through many a weary-
year,
I would not to the world impart,

The secret, the secret of its power,
But treasur'd in my inmost heart

I keep my faded flower, I keep my
faded flower.

CHORUS

'Tis but a little faded flower,

But oh, how fondly dear,
'Twill bring me back one golden hour,

Thro' many, thro' many a weary year

Where is the heart that does not keep,

Withtn its inmost core,
And some remembrance hidden deep,

Of days, of days that are no more;
Who hath not saved some trifling thing,

More prixed, more prixed than jewels rair,
A faded flower, a broken ring,

hair.

'Tis but I little faden flower,
Once the fairest flower in May,

It brings me back my chieldhood hours,
Through woods where oft I cared to
stray.

But years have passed, and I have known,
Youth's day-dreams, youth day-dreams fly

away,

Just like this little faded flower,

That pine and pass away, that pine and

pass  away.
