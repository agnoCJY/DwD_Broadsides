The young

DAMOSELS   COMPLAIN

For being slighted by a Youngman in a Palmers Weed.
To the Tune of the, Gaberluingie Man.

T He Carle came hirpling ov'ratree
With many fair sleetching good dayes & good
Saying good wise, for your Courtesy    (deens to me,
Will you lodge a silly poor man ?

2.

The night was rainy and he was all wett,

And down before  the fire he satt,
He flung his Meal-pock off his back

And he began and sang.

                                             3.

And C (quoth he) gif I were as free,
As first , when I came to this Countrey;

Then blyth and merry would I be,
And I would never think lang, O!

4.
O then (quoth she) gif I were as white,

As ever the snow lay on the dike!
Then would I dress me Lady-like,

And with thee, I would gang.

                                       5.

Then(quoth he) gif thou wert as black,

As ever the Croun of thy Fathers hatt,
Gif thou would lye down by my back,

And with me thou should gang.

6.
These two together made a plott,

To rise a little before the Cock ;
And so cunningly they shutt the lock,

And to the fields they'r gon.

                                           7.

Be times in the morning the good wife she rose,

And laisily put on here Cloaths;
And to the Servant Lass she goes :

Where lyes this poor old Man..
8.
She did gang , where the poor man lay ;

And the Strae was cold and he was away,
She clapped here hands, and cry'd wallawae:

For some of her gear his gone.

9.
Some ran to Coffers, and some to Chests,

But there was nothing there, which she had mist:
She clapped her hands and cry'd thanks be blest,

Wee mett with a leill poor man.

                                        10.

But who can ease me of my pain

To bring these Tray tors back again :
For he's be burnt, and she's be slayn,

That woefull Gaberlungie man.

11.

Some rade on Horses, and some on foot,
The wife was so sorry, she ran out of her wit.

But she was twice as far out of the gate
Even with that Gaberluingie man.

                                   12.

Mother she sayes, I do you exhott,

It any such Beggars come athort,
Give them a little of your support,

And let them not stay too long O!

13.
For if they stay but over a night

Sure all things then will not rule right.
For I have gotten such ane a slight,

Even with this Gaberlungie man.

                                      14.

Yet will I sell both Rock and Reel,
And so will I my Spinning-wheel.

And I will buy ane Staff of Steel,
And with him I will gang, O!

                                    15.

His Reply

Fair maid , (he sayes)thou art too young
Thou hast not learnt the Beggers tongue
To follow me from Town to Town ,
And bear my Gaberluingie, O!

16.

Her Reply.
I will cruick my leg and bow my knee

And draw a black cloute over mine eye,
And some time, creeple, they will call n
And with thee I will gang , O! 

                                   17.

If my Mother wist, that I were with you

So ill fav'rd ly  she wad cruick, her mo
And another poor man she wad never trow,

For such a Gaberluingie, O!

18.

His Reply.
Fair maid, if thou gang, thou shalt no't

And I's lay thee every night by my side
And I's dresse thee as ever was any Bride :

For I's dresse thee as Ican, O! 

                          19.

Her Reply.
With Calk and Keel I shall win my bread,

And with Spinnels and Thorles; gif yesta
And that's a Genty Trade Indeed
And I'le bear thy Gaberluingie man,
FINIS.
