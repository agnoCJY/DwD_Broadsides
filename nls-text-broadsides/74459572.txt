THE  GIPSEY KING.

'Tis I'm the gipsey king
Ha, ha,
And where is the king like me?
No troubles my dignities bring,
No other is half so free.
In my kingdom there is but one table,
All my subjects partake of my cheer,
We'd all drink Champagne, were we able,
As it is, we have plenty of beer.

For I am, &c,

A king and a true one am I,
No courtier or minister near;
I see every thing with my own eye,
And hear every thing with my own ear.
No conspiracy I apprehend,
Among brothers and equals I rule;
We all help both to gain and to spend,
And get drunk when the measure is full.

For I am, &c.

I confess that I am but a man,
My failings who pleases may know,
I'm fond of my girl and my can,
And my jolly companions a row!
My subjects are kind to me,
They don't grudge me the largest glass,
Nor yet that I hold on my knee,
At this moment the prettiest lass.

For I am, &c.

Ne'er a king do I envy, nor Pope, sir,
Who sits on a golden throne;
And I'll tell you the reason why, sir,
Here's a sceptre and a ball of my own:
To sit all night through in a crown,
I've a notion my cann it would freeze,
So I pull my old night-cap down,
And tipple and smoke at my ease.

For I am, &c.
