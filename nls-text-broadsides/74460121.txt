Dispatches have been received from St. Melana, which contain the
important intelligence of the decease of Buonaparte.  He expired
on Saturday the 3th of May, about six o'clock in the evening, of a
lingering illness, which had confined him to his bed for upwards of
60 days.    He desired that after his death his body might be open-
ed, as he suspected he was dying of the same disease which had kill-
ed his father, viz. a cancer in the stomach.  On opening the body,
this was found to be correct, as a cancer had actually taken place
He was sensible till the last day, and died without pain.

During the first four weeks of his illness it did
not assume any dangerous appearance, though he
appeared himself co scious that it would terminate
fatally. During the last fortnight it was evident
to all his medical attendants that he could  not sur-
vive.

He has been lying in state since she 7th. It is
said that he gave directions about his affairs and
papers till about 6 hours before he died, The body
was opened by his own surgeon.  He has left a will
which with his other papers will be transmitted to
this country. He was born in 1769.

The dispatches were brought by Captain Crokat
of the 20th Regiment. They were instantly com-
municated to ministers, and to the ambassadors, by
whom couriers are dispatched to their diffetent
courts.
