THE    STAR

OF

G L E N G A R Y .

The red moon is up  on the moss-covered mountain; 

The hour is at hand when I promis'd to rove,
With the turf-cutter's daughter by Logan's bright water
And tell her how faithful her Donald can love.

I ken there's the miller, wi' plenty o' siller,
Would fain win a glance o' her beautiful e'e;

But my ain bonny Mary, the Star o' Glengary,
Keeps a' her sweet smiles and soft kisses for me.

Tis long since we first trod the Highlands together,

Two frolicsome bairns, gaily starting the deer;
When I ca'd thee my life, my ain bonny wee wife,

     Sic joy  ne'er was seen as when Mary was near!

And still she's the blossom I wear in my bosom,â€”

A blossom I'd cherish and wear till I dee;
For my ain bonny Mary, the Star o' Glengary,
She's health, and she's wealthy and a good wife to me.
