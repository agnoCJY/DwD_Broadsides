THE  BOY IN BLUE.

Cheer up, cheer up, my mother  dear,

O why do you sit and weep?
Do you thnik that He who guards me here

Forsakes on the deep?
Let hope and faith illume the glance

That sees the bark set  sail;
Look, look at her now, and see her dance,

O  why do you turn so pale ?

'Tis an English ship and an English crew,
So mother be proud of your boy in blue.

O wonder not, that next to thee,

1  love the galloping wave,

'Tis the first of coursers wild and free,

And only carries the brave ;

It has borne me nigh to the dark lee shore,
But we struggled heart and hand,

And a light with the sea in its angry roar
Shames all your strife on land.

The storm was long, but it found me true,

So mother be proud of your boy in blue.

And if the breakers fill our ship

And your boy goes down in the foam 
Be sure the last breath on his lip

Is a prayer for those at home.
But come, cheer up ! methinks I heard

A voice in  the anchor chain,

That whispered, like a fairy bird,

The bark will soon come back again.
But never weep for your boy in blue,
God bless you, mother, adieu, adieu !
