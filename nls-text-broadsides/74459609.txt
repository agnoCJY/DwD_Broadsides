The Lassie's Wardrobe.

[Given in Chambers's Journal, No. 175, where it is
said to have been written by an old unmarried lady as
a kind of burlesque of her own habits and history. It
is sung to an air resembling that of " The Laird of
Cockpen."]

A lass lived down by yon burn-braes,
And she was weel provided wi' claes ;
She had three mutches a' but twa,
And nae bonnie lad wad tak' her awa'.

Tak' her awa', tak' her awa',
Nae bonnie lad wad tak' her awa';
She had three mutches a' but twa,
And nae bonnie lad wad tak' her awa'.

She had a gown it was just at the making,
It wanted the forebreadth, it wanted the backing;
It wanted the sleeves, the lining and a,
And nae bonnie lad wad tak' her awa'.

Tak' her awa', &c.

She had twa stockings, they were at the knitting,
They wanted the legs, they wanted the fitting,
They wanted the heids, the heels, and a',
And nae bonnie lad wad tak' her awa'.
Tak' her awa', & c.

She had a shawl, it was just like a riddle,
It wadna be the waur o' the threid and the needle;
For the middle was holed, and the border awa',
And nae bonnie lad wad tak' her awa'.
Tak' her awa', &c.

She had a pouch to hand her siller,
Wi' it she thocht to catch the miller ;
But she tint the pouch, the siller, and a',
And nae bonnie lad wad tak' he. awa'.

Tak' her awa', &c.

She had a kist tae haud her claes,
It might ha' ser'd her a' her days;
But, like a gowk, she gied it awa',
And nae bonnie lad wad tak' her awa',
Tak' her awa', &c.

Sae now she lives in a wee bit garret,
Without a friend but a cat and a parrot;
For her father is dead, and her mither and a',
And nae bonnie lad has ta'en her awa'.

Ta'en her awa'. &c.

And what can she do but live her lane,
Sin' a' her hopes o' marriage are gane;
For she's auld, she's bauld, she's wrinkled, and a'.
And nae bonnie lad wad tak' her awa'.
Tak' her awa', &c.

Now listen, fair damsels, to my lays,

Ye wha are vain about your claes;

For if ye're no guid as weel as braw,

O nae bonnie lad will tak' ye awa'.
Tak' ye awa', tak' ye awa",
Nae bonnie lad will tak' ye awa',
If ye're no guid as weel as braw,
O nae bonnie lad wad tak' ye awa',
