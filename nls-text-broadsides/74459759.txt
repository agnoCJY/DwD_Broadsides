WHERE HAS SCOTLAND
FOUND HER FAME:

Where has Scotland found her fame,

Why is she enshrined in story,
By the deeds of many a name,

Sing the theme of deathless story.
By her mountains wild and grand,

By her lakes so camly flowing,
By her peace that rules the land;

And her hearts so truly glowing.

By the freedom she can claim,
And her ancient bards so hoary,

There has Scotia found her fame,
There has Scotia found her glory.

Where has Scotland found her fame,

Ever brave she rides the ocean,
Where the dastard dare proclaim,

Nations own her high promotion.
Maidens natural and fair,

Love as warm as summer weather,
Sons that will all danger bear,

Roam among the blooming beather.

Art and science crown her name,

Genius and romantic story,
There has Scotia found her fame,

There has Scotia found her glory.
