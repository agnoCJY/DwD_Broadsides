THEY'RE A' TEASING ME.

O'wha is he I love sae well?
who has my heart an a'
O wha is he, tis sair to tell,
he's o'er the seas awa,.
There's Charlie, he's a sodger lad.
and Davie blythe is he;
And Willie in his tartan plaid,
they're a' a' teasing me.

O they're a' teasing,
they're a' teasing me;
They're a' teasing.
O they're a teasing me.

There's Carl the chief o' Daftne glen,
and he has land and store,
With flow'ry mead and shady fen,
and siller o'er and o'er.
Quoth he, sweet lass, I'll marry thee,
yestreen in yonder shaw;
And thou my ain sweet bride shall be.
and Queen o' daftne ha'

But when my Jamie comes again
young Carl will then descry,
That siller is but empty gain,
to hearts no gowd can buy
My Jamie's brave, my Jamie's braw,
my Jamie's a' to me.
And tho' his siller store be sma',
yet married we will be.
