LOVE LETTER.

Hast thou no pity for my woes?
Dost thou at me turn up thy nose ?
I'll make my declaration first,
So read straight forward and be curst,â€”
But if your heart to me incline,
Oh ! jump o'er every other line !

The great affection I have hitherto expressed for you
is false, and I now feel that my indifference towards you
increases every day, and the more I see you, the more
you appear ridiculous in my eyes, and an object of contempt.
I feel inclined, and in all respects disposed and determined, to
hate you. Believe me, I never in the least intended to
offer you my hand. Our last conversation has, I assure you,
left a tedious and wretched insipidity, which by no means has
possessed me with the most exalted opinion of your character;
your inconstant temper would always make me miserable,
and if ever we are united, I should experience nothing but
the fearful hatred of my parents, added to the everlasting dis-
pleasure in living with you. I have indeed a faithful heart
to bestow ; but, however, I do not wish you to imagine that it is
at your service, for it is impossible I could give it to one more
inconstant and capricious than yourself, and one who is less
capable to do honour to my choice and to my family.

Yes,                  , I beg and desire you will be persuaded that
I think sincerely, that you will do me the greatest pleasure
to avoid me. I shall readily excuse your taking the trouble
to return an answer to this: for your letters are always full of
nonsense and impertinence, and have not the least shadow of
wit or good sense. Adieu, and believe truly that I am
so averse to you that it is impossible I should ever be,
	Your affectionate lover,
