The Year that's awa.

Here's to the year that's awa,
We will drink it in strong and in sma'
An' here's to ilk bonnie lassie we lo'e ;
In during the year that's awa,
		And here's to ilk, &c.

Here's to the sojer wha bled,
An' the sailor who bravely did fa;
Though their fame is alive yet their spirits are fled,
On the wings of the year that's awa.
		Though their fame is alive, &c.

Here's  to the friends we can trust,
While the storms of adversity blaw :
May they live in our song and be nearest our hearts,
Nor depart like the year that's awa.
		May they live, &c.
