Upon the never Enough to be La-
mented Death, of the Right Ho'
nourable ADAM BROWN, Esq;

Lord PROVOST of   EDINBURGH,

Who Departed this Life the 16 of October; 1711,

AS soon as Death by Sin was Usber'd in,
    That Dreadful Gyant did a War begin,
Against all Adam's Race with  mighty Rage;

Without Respect to Sex, Degree or Age,
His Pow'r  is such he Conquers over all,
The Strong and Weak, alike before him Fall.
The Good and Wicked to him are alike,
He without Pitty against both doth strick,
Both tall before him,but the Righteous shall
Once Live again,and no more Die at all;
By Vertue of their Head, who now does Reign,
And hath Disarm'd this Viper of his Sting.    
This Pious Sout, whom now we do bewail,
His Anchor cast long since within the Vail:
Immortal Vertues in his Soul were town,
Which to Ripe Flowers of  Glory now are grown;
Unbyass'd Zealard Piety did still
O're Rule his Passions, and his Soul did still,
With all the Livclie Graces  that abound
In those who in the way to Heaven are found.
Not only did these Veccues in him shire,
Which in a Private Life, the Soul incline
To Gracious Acts and Works of Piety.
But further likewise his great Probity,
Candor and Justice made him wounderous sit
For publick Work, in Judgement Seat to sit.
Where Equal Justice he did Distribute,
To Poor and Rich, and every nice Dispute,
He presently could take and Solve the Doubt,
He for the Church had still a True Zeal,
And every thing that touch'd the Common Well,
Of City, or the Kingdom,with great Skill,
He did Espouse and Wisely Manage still.
His Works of Charity were likewise Great,
TheVagrant Poor he Bannish'd from the Street,
A nd in the Hospital made them abide,
Where he for them did Needful Food provide.      
The Work's too large to shew the Hundred part,
Of his Great Prudence, Judgement, Skill, and Art
In Managing the publick Business
Committed to his Care, allmust Confess:

The loss the publick Suffres since he's gone,
To Ripe the Fruit of all his Labours, where
All Joys and perfect Consolations are.
