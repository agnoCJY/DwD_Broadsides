DIALOGUE

Between the                                

PILLORY

AND

DANIEL DEFOE.

PILL.

A wake, thou busie dreamer, and arise,
Shake off th' unwilling slumber from thine eyes.
DE FOE. Hail dread Tribunal ! Reverend Machine,
Of awfull phyz,  and formidable mein !
Thou Prop of Justice, Adjutant of Law ;
That Keep'ft the Paper-blurring World in awe,
But why this early Visite made to me ?
Must I again ascend thy fatall Tree ?

P. No mayest thou never mount my Fabrick more,
With much concern , last time, thy Weight I bore,
And with Regrate , I see my self of late,
Made a meer tool, and Property of State ;
Time was, when knaves, whom now for Gold they spare
And such like Villains trade my bosom Care ,
The Scriv'ner and the publick Notaries,
Forgers of Bonds and Wills, were all my Votaries ;
Now I'm reverse ( fo Humane Chances Vary )
And vent the Spleen of Peevish Secretary.

D. Was it for this you broke my easy rest ?
You know what publick failures I detest,
How some Grandees, are in a Mortal rage,
To See wee know the Scandal of our Age;
And as they are the grievance of the times,
Are most affraid of hearing their own Crimes.
