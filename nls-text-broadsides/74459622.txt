The Man that Broke the Bank
at Monte Carlo.

I've just got here, through Paris, from  the sunny
southern shore,
I to Monte Carlo went, just to raise my winter's
rent;
Dame Fortune smil'd upon me as she'd never done
before,
And I've now such lots of money, I'm a gent,
Yes, now I've such lots of money, I'm a gent.

Chorus.

As I walk along the Bois Boolong,
With an independent air,
Yon can hear the girls declare—
He must be a millionaire.
You can hear them sigh
And wish to die,
Yon can see them wink the other eye
At the man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo.

I stay in doors till after lunch, and then my daily
walk,
To the great Triumphal Arch is one grand triumphal
march,
Observed by each observer with the keenness of   a
hawk,
I'm a mass of money, linen, silk, and starch.
I'm a mass of money, linen, silk, and starch.

I patronised the tables at the Monte Carlo hell,
Till they hadn't got a sou for a Christian or a Jew;
I then flew off to Paris for the charms of mad'moiselle.
Who's the loadstone of my heart—what can I do
When with twenty tongues she swears that she'll
be true ?
