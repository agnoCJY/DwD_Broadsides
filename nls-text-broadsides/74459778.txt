To the Worshipful, Cordners of the West-Port,
A humble PETITION is enter'd in Court
For Apprentice Boys, who would fain take a Drink,
Be blyth like their Masters, but want ready Clink.                                                                                                  

YE Sons of Old Crispian, a Saint and a King,
When taking your Bottle and eating your Ling,
As merry as Greeks o're a Pint and a Gill,
With the best of Good-Fellows, honest old Deacon Hill;
Remember, that wee're the same Flesh and Blood,
Tho' we have not a Bitt, and are chawing the Cud,
For tho we are young and raw mouth'd Beginners;
We may live like your selves, to be old drunken Sinners,

  On this solemn Occasion, after choosing your Deacon;
You'I  Generous prove, the Apprentices rekon; |
For on a Feast-Day, we resolve not to fast
Tho' we first pawn our Aul, and then hast to our Last.
When Lads of the Trade in Company mingle,
Can they Bend-Leather chaw or lick a cold Lingle;                         
Encourage the Trade, when your all mett together,
Refresh our Soles, and wett the Upper-Leather :
So we humbly request, like kind hearted Men;
You'I send us a hearty Charity  ben:
And we shall all Pray while our Judgements abides;
May you never wear Horns, and never want Hides.
