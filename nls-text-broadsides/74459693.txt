THE

Spiritual

RAILWAY.

The line to Heaven by Christ was made,
With heavenly truth the rails are laid,
From Earth to Heaven it doth extend,
And   eternal is the end.

Repentance is the station then,
Where passengers are taken in ;
No fee is there for them to pay,
For Jesus is himself the way.

God's word is the first engineer,
It points the way to Heaven most clear,
Through tunnels dark and dreary here.
It does the way to glory steer.

God's word the fire, his truth the steam,
Which drives the engine and the train;
Now all who would to glory ride,
Must come to Christ, and there abide.

In first, and second, and third class,
Repentance, Faith, and Holiness,
You must the way to glory gain,
Or you with Christ can never reign.

Come then, poor sinner, now's the time,
At any station on the line,
If you repent, and turn from sin,
The train will stop and take you in.
