A N S W E R. 

Sir,

The uniform tendency of your behaviour
from the earliest period of our acquaintance, has
Inspired me and has given me a very high opinion
of your politeness and integrity, and  if I should
ever be induced to change my present condition
youare the only man capable of inspiring me with
such an  idea. Your letter has afforded me the
greatest satisfaction, by convincing me I possess
your esteem. With respect to your heart did it
offer to me the refusal, some difficulties might oc-
cur. Matrmony ought not to be formed without
very due consideration and I  own I should prefer
you should such an event take place. I cannot
conclude without returning my thanks  for your
candour, and I shall follow your example by assur-
ing you, with great sincerity that I am, Sir.

Your well-wisher and sincere friend,
Mary Miller.
