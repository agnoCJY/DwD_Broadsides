TUNEâ€”Original.

I'm a bold Irish hero, who never yet was daunted,          
In the courting of a pretty girl I very seldom wanted,
In the courting of a pretty girl I own it was my folly,
I would venture my life for my pretty Molly.

CHORUS.

Mush a ring a do a da, fal lal da do da addy,
Mush a ring a do a da, there's whisky in the jar.

As I was a walking over Wicklow mountain,
I met with Colonel Powers, and his money he was counting,
I pulled out my sword, and likewise my rapier,
Saying, stand and deliver, for I'm a bold deceiver.

It's when I got the money it was a pretty penny,
I put it in my pocket, and I took it home to Molly;
She said, my dearest Pat, I never will deceive you,
But the devil's in the women, they never can be easy.

I went to Molly's chamber, you'll think it little wonder,
I laid my head upon her bed for to get a slumber;
But as I lay sleeping, I knew not of the matter,
She unloaded my two pistols, and filled them full of water.

And as I lay sleeping, I dreamed of my pretty Molly,
I saw Colonel Powers, and four stout able fellows,
I flew to my pistols, but I found I was mistaken,
Out flashed the water, and a prisoner I was taken.

Oh, Molly, dearest Molly, now since you have deceived me,
Over high hills and mountains I'm forced for to leave you;
I am to blame, but you are the faulter,
You have brought my poor head almost to a halter.

It's I have two brothers, and they are in the army,
The one lies in Cork, the other in Killarney,
And if I had them here I would be blythe and jolly,
I would rather have them now, than you, my pretty Molly.

It's when they led me through the hall,
I threw back the soldiers and loudly did call,
Many have I robbed, but never yet killed any,
And now I must die on the plains of Kilkenny.
