The   Poor

FORSAKEN

VILLAGE

A  VILLAGE maid she sat weeping
She thought of happy days
gone by,
And as her darling babe lay sleeping
A tear fell gently from her eye.
She thought of home and her deceiver
Poor girl by him she was betrayed,
She's left alone now broken hearted,
The poor forsaken village maid.

Chorus.

Left alone there's many like her,
From a parent's home they are be-
trayed,
Poor girl by many she's insulted.
The poor forsaken village maid.

She thinks of her dear aged parents,
She left behind in grief and woe,
Her cheeks now pale were once like roses,
She wanders on with footsteps slow
To town she came with her intended,
She lived in splendour for a while,
But he soon slighted that poor creature
She thinks while gazing at her child

Her village home she'll ne'er forget it
When a  little child so gay and free
With her dailing little brother,
She played by her dear mother's knee
Her beauty was admired by many,
She trusted one who, her betrayed.
He soon won her with his goldent 
treasure
The poor forsaken village maid.

She thinks she hears the bells a-chim-
ing,
She fancies she's at home once more
Where all was joy and sweet content
ment
Those happy days alas are o'er
She wends her way towards the river
Her little babe it seems afraid,
She sinks beneath the dark blue water
Poor forsaken village maid.
