The Maid

OF THE

RHINE.

Thou dark rolling River, how gladly for ever,
I'd dwell on the rich banks, all rich with the vine,
That bright sky above thee, how fondly I'd love thee,
If blest with the heart of the maid of the Rhine.

Thy dales and thy mountains, thy floods and thy fountains
So fondly around my remembrance entwine,
Yet  happy in loving, would still be deserving,
If blest with the heart of the maid of the Rhine.

No more would I languish, in sorrow and anguish,
For climes that are warmer, and lovelier than thine,
But  happy in loving, would cease from my roving,
If blest with the heart of the maid of the Rhine.
