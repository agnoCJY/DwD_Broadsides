TUNEâ€”Original.
	
	I am the member of a school
	Where the master is a fool,
And all the pupil teachers are the same,
	And for kicking up a noise,
	They have called us the jolly boys,
And I think that we are deserving of that name.
	You should see us when we are met,
	I am sure you would ne'er forget,
The awful tricks that we do carry on,
	For stamping with our feet,
	Or tumbling on the seats,
Or pulling down some charming girl's chignon.

CHORUS.

So, oh ! boys, join me in the chorus,
Sing aloud, and make an awful noise,
	Oh do not look so shy,
	But come and be as I,
A member of our jolly school of boys.

	Now it is a lady we have got
	For to teach our happy lot,
And, oh !  but she is generous and kind,
	For she brings her pockets full,
	Every Sunday to the school,
And that keeps us quiet for a while ;
	But as soon as they are done,
	Then we begin the fun,
And then an awful hubbub we do raise,
	While she tries to teach the rest,
	I begin some foolish jest,
Or larking while they sing the psalms of praise.

	Now right opposite our class,
	There sits a blooming lass,
And at me she blushingly does  hang her head ;
	And this damsel so divine,
	Has promised to be mine,
And soon she to the altar will be led.
	And this damsel fair,
	I solemnly declare,
Has consented for to give her hand at last;
	But I fear she has stole my heart,
	For she is so jolly smart,
She is the cleverest pickpocket in the class.

	Now the master often swears
	That he will kick us all down stairs,
If ever we go back there again ;
	But of course I must make it right,
	When we call each Sunday night,
For he is one of those generous sort of men.
	But now I must away,
	No longer I can stay,
Quite long enough I think I've been your fool,
	But if you have a mind
	Our jolly school to join,
Just you come down on Sunday to the school.
