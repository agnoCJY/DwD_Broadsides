Wedding Song
ON
The   Marraige    of John   Brown,
Merchant in Holland. and Mar-
garet Hepburn, Daughter to the
Laird of Banfoot,
Solemnized 28 of July 1714.

THE Beanty new of Edinburgh Town,
She's Chang'd her Collour into Brown,
After it's so long Preservation,
Shes like to pass out of this Nation,
That She may Learn the Holand Fashon,
To Ear her Butter with Garleik,
And so become a Lazie Freik,
By mixing Bear with Brandy Wine,
Makes Young Pigs grow ill Favour'd Swine.
And Eat their own Flesh when they Dine,
In Sheives of Bread with Poudred Porck
Untill they Swim above like Cork
So that a Bairfoot must be best,
To Equalize all of that Nest,
Where de Ruters and de Veits,
Came to be Cut into Bits,
Magie had better kept at Home,
Than thither gone and Bairfoot come
Again, when she's not worth a Plack,
And her Brown turned is to Black,
Like those who Suiters were to her,
Who are grown mad and knows not where,
To find their Fancie till Return,
They see their old Jo Magie Hepburne,
Come Home again and Change her Hew,
Of Rid and White from Brown to Blew.
