An Excellent Song
I N T I T U L E D
Fy gar rub her o're wi Strae,

An Italian Canzone (of seven hundred Years Standing) imitated in braid Scot;
 

Gin ye meet a bonny Lassie
Gie her a Kiss and let her gae,
But if she be a dirty Hussy,
Fy gar rub her o're wi Strae.
Fy gar rub her, fy gar rub her.
Fy gar rub her o're wi Strae.
But if she be a bonny Lassie,
Give her a Kiss and let her gae.


Be sure ye dinna quat the Grip,
Of ilka Joy when ye are young,
Before auld Age your Vitals nip,
And lay ye twafald o're a Rung.
Fy gar rub her,fy gar rub her,
fy gar rub her, o're wi Strae,
But if she be a bonny Lassiie,
give her a Kiss and let her gae.

Sweet Youths a blyth and hartsom Time,
then Lads and Lasses while it's May
Gae pow the Gowan in it's Prime,
before it wither and Decay,
Fy gar rub her, fy gar rub her,
fy gar rub her o're wi Strae.
But if she be a bonny Lassie,
give her a Kiss and let her gae.

Watch the fast Minutes of Delyte,
When Jeany speaks beneath her Breath
And Kisses laying a the Wyte
On you if she kepp ony Skath,
Fy gar rub her, fy gar rub her
Fy gar rub her o're wi Strae,
But if she be a bony Lassie
give her a Kiss and let her gae.

Haith ye're ill bred she'll smilling say
ye'll worry me ye greedy Rook,
Syn frae your Arms she'll rin away
and hide her self in some dark Nook
Fy gar rub her, fy gar rub her,
fy gar rub he o're wi strae,
But if she be a bonny Lassie.
give her a Kiss and let her gae

 
Her Laugh will lead you to the Place,
Where lys the Happiness ye want,
And plainly tells you to your face,
Nineteen Naysays are haff a grant
Fy gar rub her, fy gar rub her,
fy gar rub her o're wi Strae,
But if she be a bonny Lassie,
Give her a Kiss and let her gae,

Now to her heaving Bosom cling,
and sweetly toolie for a Kiss.
Frae her fair finger whop a Ring,
as Token of a future Bless.
fy gar rub her, fy gar rub her,
fy gar rub her o're wi strae;
But if she be a bonny Lassie,
give her a Kiss and let her gae

These Bennisons I'm very sure,
are of the God's Indulgent Grant,
Then Surrly Carles, 'whisht forbear,
to Plague us with your whining Cant.
Fy gar rub her, fy gar rub her,
fy gar rub her o're wi Strae,
But if she be a bonny Lassie,
Give her a Kiss and let her gae ,
