The FREE KIRK and her Boy  TAMMY.

TUNE—" My Boy Tammy."

SCENR—Boy Tammy sitting at a Table, scouring some suspicious-looking Coppers
with Intellectual Sand, and a Leaf of the Bible.

Enter MOTHER KIRK.
" Whaur gat ye the bawbees ?
My boy Tammy;
Whaur forgather'd ye wi' these ?
My boy Tammy;
I dinna see the thistle blae—
The shamrock, nor the roses gay :
Sae tell me whaur they cam' frae—
I dinna think they're canny."

TAMMY—(scouring away)
" Ne'er fash about the bawbees,
My kind mammy ;
Speer naething.  and I'll tell nae lies,
My kind mammy :
I gat them as I gat the lave—
I ask'd,my frien's—they freely gave ;
Sae hand your tongue, and dinna rave—
Thir cam frae Indiana."

KIRK—(gazing earnestly at a cent)—
" There's 'bluid upon the bawbees,
My boy Tammy ;
There's bluid upon the bawbees.
My boy Tammy;
There's bluid- I feel my vitals freeze —
I'm fear'd —I faint—my heart misgi'es—
A curse is on the bawbees !
Awa'-—they are nae canny.

TAMMY—(Terrified, imploringly)
" Hush ! dinna speak in sic a strain,
My kind mammy;
Just listen, and I'll mak' it plain,
My kind mammy;
I'll prove—just set your mind at ease—
I'll prove—eh ?—ony thing you please—
I'll prove that they're a' guid bawbees,
My sweetest, sweetest mammy."

KIRK— (solemnly)
" I've heard a voice on thunder borne,
My boy Tammy;
I've seen the' finger raised in scorn,
My boy Tammy :
Heaven rings wi' DOUGLAS'S appeal,
An' thrills my heart like burnin' steel,
An' conscience racks me on the wheel-
Ye've wrang'd—ye've griev'd your
mammy."

TAMMY—(scratching his hcad)
"Waes me, but you are gettin warou,
My kind mammy;
Ye're foamin' like a keg o' barm,
My kind mammy."

KIRK—(indignantly)
" Shall I, as free as ocean's waves,
Shake hands wi' women-whippin knaves,
An' build kirks wi' the bluid o' slaves ?—
Sen' back—SEN' BACK THE MONEY !''

TAMMY—(distracledly)
Be mercifu! an' say na mair,
My kind mammy ;                
Ye'll drive me headlong to despair,
My kind mammy ;
 Send back the------!' Oh! It canna be;
Ye're gyte ! that wad destroy, you see,
The Kirk's Infallibility!
Ca' canny—Oh ! ca' eanny !"

KIRK—(much affected)
" I'm griev'd to hear you speakin' sae.
My boy Tammy;
My auldest bairn—wae's me the day.
My boy Tammy;
I'm never out o' scrapes an' stews,
There's aye some crotchet in your views;
Ye'll stain my robes—ye'll toom my pews—
They're flockin' back to GRANNY !

TAMMY—(puzzled)
" What wad ye hae me dae? What? Fling-
Queer, queer mammy !"

KIRK—(resolutely)
" Yes; ' put away th' accursed thing.'
My boy Tammy ;
Oh ! cleanse awa' the filthy stain-
Return them a' their plunder'd gain."

TAMMY—(shaking his noddle)
" I canna do't, an' yet I'm fain."—

Enter FREDERICK DOUGLAS —
" I say, SEND BACK THAT MONEY !"

Exit TAMMY—overturning in, in his progress, the
table with the coppers, while MOTHER CHURCH
and DOUGLAS cordially shake hands.
