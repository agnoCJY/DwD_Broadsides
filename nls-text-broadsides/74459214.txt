TEN.

I mind when I courted my ain wifie Jean
Tho' often I gaed, she seldom was seen,
For her faither-the elder-like  a' godly men;
Aye steekit his door about haif-past ten.

Ae Sacrament Sabbath I saw Jeanie hame,
Ony lad wi' his lassie wae hae dnne the same,
We crackit sae lang at the cezy fire en,
That the time slipt awa' tilt near half- past ten.

The worthy man read, syne rev'rentaly pray'd
An' when he was dune he solmnely said-
It has aye been the rule but tis likely ye ken
That we steek a' our doors about half-past ten,

The hint was enough fora blate lad like me,
But I catched a bit blink o' Jeanies black e'e,
As much as to say come ye back to the glen
And yo'll may be stay langer than half- past ten.

Ae night twa three lads an mysel did  agree,
To gang some place near jist to hae a bit spree
Quo I, what do ye think o' gaun doon to the glen,
For we're sure to be hame about half-past ten.

We a' were received wi' a hearty guid will,
An the elder nae less broached a cask o' his yill
Syne gaed aff to his bed, and says Jeanye'll attend,
That the doors are a luckit by half-past ten.

Ou ay, says Joan, but the best o' the joke   
was her slipp n ben and stopp \ill\n the clock,
I'm no gaun to tell you the boo or the  when,
But the hauns were'na pointing to half-past ten.

About four in the morning the auld man arose,
An lightin a spunk to the clock straught he goes-
Gude save us   guidwife, did ye hear me gae ben,
Le'd the lads are awa' afore half-past ten,

But the cat vera sune was let oot o' the pock,
By the keeklin o' hens an the craw o' the cock,
An' openin the shutters he clearly saw then
We wad a' hao our breakfasts ere half-past ten.

Ye ne'er heard such laughing a' the days o' yer life,
And nane were sae hearty s the auld man an' his wite
Quo he, what'll the lassies no dae for the men,
E'en cheat their auld faithers wi' half-past ten.

It was a settled then that Jean should be mine,
The wedding sune followed an' we're aye sinsyne,
Leev'd happy thegither, an' hope to the en',
We'll aye min' that nicht an' its half-past ten.

And noo a wee bit advice I wad gie-          
Ne'er stint young folks time when they gang to a' spree,
I'm a faither mysel' but brawly I ken,
That the fun jist begins about half-past ten.
