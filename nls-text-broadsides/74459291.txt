Lass, gin ye Lo'e Me

PRICE ONE PENNY.

In Herd's collection the following fragment  is  preServed-

I ha'e layen three herrings a-sa't;
Bonnie lass, gin ze'll tak' me, tell me now;
And 1 ha'e brew'n three pickles o' ma't,
And i canna cum ilka day to woo.
To woo, to woo, to lilt and to woo,
And i canna cum ilka day to woo.

1 ha'e a wee calf that wad fain be a cow ;
Bonnie lass, gin ze'll tak' me, tell me now;
I  ha'e a grice that would fain he a sow,
And I canna cum ilka day to woo.
to  woo, to  woo, &e.

From this fragment, James Tytler constructed the following
song, which, with its lively air, is given in the third volume
of Johnson's Museum. Tytler was the son of a clergyman at
Brechin and though educated first for the church, and after-
wards for the medical profession, he was mainly employed
through life in literary and chemical speculations. He died
in Massachusetts, North America, in 1805, aged 58. He was
commonly called Balloon Tytler, from having been the first
in Scotland who ascended in a fire balloon upon the plan of
Montgolfier. The late Mr Mackay, of the Edinburgh theatre,
used to sing this song with pawkie glee, and was instramental
in rendering it popular. Copies can only be had in the Poet's-
Box, 6 St Andrew's Lane, Glasgow.

Air—Original.

I Hae laid a herring in saut—
Lass, gin ye lo e me, tell me now;
I hae brew'd a forpit o' maut,
An' I canna come ilka day to woo;
I hae a calf that will soon be a cow—
Lass, gin ye lo'e me, tell me now;
I hae a stook, and I'll soon hae a mowe,
And I canna come ilka day to woo.

I hae a house upon yon moor—
Lass, gin ye lo'e me, tell me now;
Three sparrows may dance upon the floor,
And I canna come ilka day to woo;
I hae a butt, an' I hae a ben—
Lass, gin ye lo'e me, tell me now;
A penny to keep, and a penny to spen',
An' I canna come ilka day to woo.

I hae a hen wi' a happitie leg—
Lass, gin ye lo'e me, tell me now;
That ilka day lays me an egg,
An' I canna come ilka day to woo;
I hae a cheese upon my shelf—
Lass, gin ye lo'e me, tell me now;
And soon wi' mites 'twill rin itself,
And I canna come ilka day to woo.
