The Forsaken Lover;

O   R
The Female's Blast.

HEr vows of love
They seem'd to prove
Most faithful unto me ,

But now I've sound

Which doth me  wound
In them no constancy,

She now and then

Seem'd to maintain,
Her amorous Affection,

Which proved  false,

Yea turned was,
To odious rejection ,

Most certainly
Now do I see
That Females do advise

Deceit and guile,

Even with a smile,
Vain lovers then be wife 

Let not vain love

Your fancy   move ,
from  whence nought can re

But may at last      ( dound

Prove but a blast,
To thee a  fatal wound,

Experience,

doth teach me hence ,
That love which in great measure

Fantastick   brain                  

Doth  count as gain,
Nought is but ending pleasure,

For love they may

For you to day
Protest ; tomorrow none 

For they perhaps

Take a relapse.
Then thou art left alone ;
