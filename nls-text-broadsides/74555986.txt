The LASSES of KlNGHORN



Tune of Clavers and his Highland Men.

All Gentlemen and Cavaliers
that doth delight in sport,
Come here and listen to my song,
for it shall be but short :
And i'le tell you as brave a Jest,
as ever you did hear :
The Lasses of Kingborn Town
put our Officers  in fear.

It fel  Upon a Wednesday
the Month of February,
Some of the brave Commanders
came to Kinghorn Ferry,
Having with them a Chapman Iad,
a prisner they had seen,
The Tide was spent  e're they came there,
and to the Town the're gane.

And as they went along the street
the Chapman made his Moan.
He wrang his hands and said, alas,
that ever he was born;
For I'm a silly poor Pedler,
from me they ta'en my Pack,
Of all my seven years gathering
they left me not a plack,

But yet with this they'r not content.
nor will they pass me so,
But i must be a Soger,
to Flanders I must go.
To Flanders I must go?
a Soger for to be.
But I will die e're I come  there,
I'll be so sick at sea.

The Women were much moved
to hear him make his Moan.
And some of them most courteously
up to the Captain's gone,
Desiring him of Charity
that he would let him gang
But be answered them disdainfully,
he'd rather see him hang.

The women were much moved,
and took this as a sight,
Said he should be relieved
in spite of all their Might:
They gathered right hastly,
and forth into  row,
With Bleaching Knocks and Harrow Bills
I not they were not slow.

The Captains they went back again,
and out their Swords did draw,
The women then they leugh at them,
of that they stood not awe ;
But then on them they throng'd so fast
unto the  ground them dang,
And took the Swords out of their hands,
and soundly did them bang.

The Captains they got up again,
and longer durst not hide,
For little of their Valour
I'm sure was seen that side:


The women they charg'd furiosly;
till that they made them  run
With Bleeching Knocks and Harrow Bills
but neither Sword nor Gun.

The Women they charg'd furiously,
ran down the Brae like fire,
They made the Captains stand in awe,
and yield to their desire :
The first was Captain Wilson,
with a Rung in her hand,
She made The Captain stand in awel
and yield to her Command.

The next  was Major Stenson
and her sister also,                      
Give me the Pedler's Pack again
e're that ye further go
She took the Serjint by the breast,
She threw him on his back:
Lieutenant Binel hastily
took up the chapmans  Pack,

But out came Colonel Turnbul,
that honest Widow Wife,
She asked at her Comerades,
what meaned all this strife;
They've taken a silly poor Pedler,
and will not let him go:
She answered them couragiously
faith it shall not be so.

She took a Knock into her hand,
of Bleeching she is good,
she caus'd the Serjant stagger
in the place where he stood.
And in her hand in his Pocket
and out the Purse did draw,
Give him a click out o'er the Crown;
awa ye Rogue awa

The Sailers they leugh heartily
for to behold the sport,
To see the Captains run away
for shelter to the Boat:
But up spake General Paterson.
She spake with Counsel good,
And she desired to sound retreat,
for she  would have no Blood.

For we've got the Pedlers pack & Purse
and this is all had he,
Had it not been for King William's sake;
we'd drown'd them in the Sea.
The Captains then they were right glad,
when that this News they heard,
Desir'd the Seamen hoise their Sails.
and not longer to bide.

For we have all been Soger,
more then this dozen of years.
And all the Battels we were at,
we were never in such Fears,
O fy on you for Sogers
that ever you took pay,
The Lasses of Kinghorn Town
they made you run away;
