Flora's Lament  for her

CHARLIE.

It's you bonny banks, and yon bonny braes,
Whers the sun shines bright and bonny,
Where I and my true love went out for to gaze,
On the bonny, bonny banks of Benlomond.

It's you'll take the high road and I'll t√§ke the low
And I'll be in Scotland before you,
For I and my true love shall never meet again,
On the bonny, bonny banks of Benlomond.

It's not for the hardships that I must endure,
Nor the leaving of Benlomond;
But it's for the leaving of my comrades all,
And the bonny lad that I love so dearly,

With his bonny laced shoes and his buckles  so
	clear,
And his plaid o'er his shoulders hung so rarely ;
One glance of his eye it would banish dull care,
So handsome was the look's of my Charlie.

But as long as I live and as long as I breath,
I will sing of his memory sairly;
My true love was taken by the arrows of death,
And now Flora does lament for her Charlie.
