THE HIGHLAND SOLDIER.

This Popular Song can always be had at the Poet's Box,
224 Overgate, Dundee.

Owre  yon hills not far awa,

There dwells a lovely maiden,
As she strolled out, ae simmer's night
For to view the soldiers paradin'.

CHORUSâ€”

For they walk so neat and they dress so gay,
The drums they do beat and the pipes they do play,
Which caused lovely Mary for to sigh and say

I will follow my Highland soldier.
Oh, Mary, dear, my pay's but small,

And on yon battlefield I might fall ;

And you sae far from your father's hame

Tae be led by a Highland soldier.

CHORUS.
Oh, I've got fifty pounds in store.

And I've got the, heart worth ten times more,
And I'll give it to the lad that, I adore ;
I would die for my Highland soldier.
CHORUS.

O, Mary, dear, as you've been so true.

And you've been tender-hearted.
Here is my hand and married we will be,

And never more be parted.
CHORUS.
